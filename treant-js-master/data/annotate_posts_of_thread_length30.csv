I too don’t use the grammar feature but I love the spell check sound. Saves me a lot of time on email creation. Jenine Stanleydragonwalker64@...",2016.2.1,30,

5277,valiant8086,2016-06-10 14:12:07.351868682,"Hi.I don't know how uninstalling CCleaner could have caused this. Try uninstalling speakDropbox and then installing the latest version again. You don't need to manually delete folders or anything like that. The goal of reinstallation is to get it to re-add the dll files that handle speech in the hopes that'll straighten it out. Another possible explanation would be that it thinks you have other screen readers running too, although in that case it probably would still default to JAWS as highest priority. Have you rebooted the computer yet?Cheers, Aaron Spears, general Partner - Valiant Galaxy Associates Developing ""very good audiogames"" for the blind community http://valiantGalaxy.com Sent with Thunderbird 45.1.1 portable",2016.2.1,30,5340

By the way, if you right click on the start icon, you will get the same choices as pressing Windows+X. Take care.",2016.2.1,30,

5406,Clare Page,2016-06-13 10:12:02.279798256,"Hi!Here's my answer to your question, Semirhage , and I hope others will agree with me.Even though some things in NVDA updates may help Windows 10 users, NVDA is still compatible with all Windows versions from XP onwards, so plenty of improvements to NVDA arriving in each update will work on Windows 7 as well. I use Windows 7 here, and updating NVDA has never caused any extra problems for me, so any Windows 7 user can still safely install NVDA updates, given that many of the changes benefit all of us, not just Windows 10 users.Bye for now!From Clare",2016.2.1,30,
