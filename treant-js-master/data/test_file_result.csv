While I have mixed feelings about this, I’m more worried about what VFO and other parties will go through in the next while.As for response, as a community, I think it is better to use reasoned and ethical advocacy than rushed, emotional retweets and replies. I’m sure of us might be thinking that retweets is a reasonable form of advocacy and that’s all. I’d say not: retweets is just one thing, but reasonable advocacy involves willingness to think things through and come up with educated arguments. I myself advised VFO to reevaluate their corporate attitudes, sales strategies and public relations front based on content presented in this article and from other reports, and did warn them that they’ll have to answer tough questions.Cheers,Joseph",A very damn well written article promoting NVDA,33,18727

18742,Gene,2017-05-24 17:26:15.674135140,"The article makes interesting points but it's 
really overdone.  Here is most of a message I sent to another list on the 
subject.  I have added more comments.  
 
The assertion that a screen-reader can make a great 
piece of spyware sounds plausible to me, someone without in depth technical 
knowledge.  I suspect that it is technically true but I hardly think that 
VFO would risk the reputation of JAWS by doing so.  It would be illegal on 
its face, I would think and it would certainly be illegal if it weren't spelled 
out in the user agreement.  JAWS is very heavily dependent on business use 
for its revenue.  As one example of liability, if JAWS collected 
information, anyone business or individual doing medical work in The United 
States where a person's name is ever used, could prosecute VFO for violating the 
patient privacy act.  And that's just one example that comes to mind.  
Are there blind psychiatrists or psychologists or social workers or people who 
work for them who use JAWS to keep patient records?  Another case of 
devastating liability for JAWS.  How about lawyers?  The idea that the 
owners of JAWS would turn it into spyware is just not credible.  To 
paraphrase the late Justice Scalia, it should strain the credulity of the 
credulous.  People may criticize JAWS and its developers for various 
reasons but it makes no sense to believe that the company is suicidal.  

 
And what is the risk when compared to the 
benefits?  The blind user base isn't large enough nore affluent enough to 
even begin to justify such risks, even if the company were suicidal.  

 
I'd have to read the article again to see if I 
disagree with other assertions, but that was the one I really remember.  
There is no question that NVDA is a necessary program and that it fills a vital 
need in many peoples' lives.  And over time, JAWS will, I would think, lose 
an increasing amount of market share in the personal market.  It may lose 
some business market share over time as well.  But when assessing the need 
for NVDA and its future, paranoia about the irrationality of the major 
competitor is not a good basis to build a good deal of the argument.  

 
If you make such assertions, you lose credibility 
for your assertions that are well based.  And even here, one assertion I 
recall is possible but highly improbable at this time.  The assertion that 
JAWS is more likely to disappear may be correct, but its highly improbable 
unless things change dramatically and it should be regarded more as a remote 
possibility and largely academic at this time.  
 
There are lots of compelling arguments to support 
and use NVDA.  But such arguments as make up much of this article, while 
interesting and provocative, are so far-fetched, even though possible, that they 
are not a good basis to form much of such arguments.  They may gain support 
for NVDA among some people but they may needlessly erode support among some JAWS 
users, making NVDA appear more like a project supported by paranoid fanatics 
than what it actually is, a project that is hard-headed and realistic in its 
development and outlook.

is provide security updates.  It provides such support because many people 
can't use Edge yet because they don't use Windows 10.  Also, Edge is not 
fully accessible yet.  But no technical improvements have been made in 
Internet Explorer for years.  It is really legacy software that gets 
security fixes at this point.
 
One feature firefox has that some blind people find 
useful is one that removes lots of extraneous material from web pages with 
articles on them such as newspaper or magazine articles.  
 
Another feature I very much like is searchable book 
marks.  I don't worry about organizing book marks.  I can search for 
the one I want so easily that if it is inconvenient to get to it by arrowing or 
by first letter navigation, I do a search.  I don't use addons to any

many.  
 
And I suspect that Internet Explorer, as it ages, 
works more poorly on more sites than firefox or Chrome.  Also, Internet 
Explorer supports Active X controls which are a needless security risk.  
Neither Firefox nor Chrome support Active X controls by default and site 
designers don't use them these days.  But Internet Explorer still supports 
them, providing a useless feature, that serves as a vector to try to put malware 
onto machines.

I read the article and though we as Gene and Travis said cannot allow ourselves to go stark raving mad against any group and compare it to the dregs of the computing world, and send it down the flaming lava pit of the nearest active volcano, Chris did
 make a number of valid points. The point that stuck with me most was what we as a group can do.  As a community we have lots of juice, let's continue to use it.  Through the continuing support of the project by all of us here, talking it up, promoting it,
 souping it up, to be the best of the screen reading lot, and make it the best piece of adaptive software on the market.  The more we keep our hands in it as visually impaired users whether it be through programming, instructing, writing tips, tricks, and manuals
 for users, blogging, and even posting on social media to spread the word about it overtime should move anything that's thrown our way aside. Just my take.

I totally agree with what you said.


The part in the article that stood out to me most was what is below.


What Can You Do To Help?
Every screen reader user can help NVDA in their own way. A number of things you and I can do to advance NVDA and our freedoms include:
• If you have programming skills, you can do something to improve NVDA itself. You could help the core team fix bugs and add features, you can write a new plug-in providing more functionality to NVDA users and participate in various other ways as well.
• If you have good writing skills, you can help create documentation and training materials for NVDA.
• If you are multi-lingual, you can help translate NVDA documentation and training materials into languages other than English.
• If you use NVDA and find a bug, you can report it through their tracking system to ensure the programmers know about the defect so they can then find a remedy.
• If you have a social media account, you can help promote NVDA with tweets, FaceBook posts and such.
• Instead of paying for a JAWS SMA, you can send the money to NVAccess to help the people working on the software.
• If you’re a solid NVDA user, you can help other users with tips and tricks and other helpful information on mailing lists and the like.
• If you have a blog, you can write about why you like NVDA and relatively high profile people like me will help you promote your stories on social media.
• If you’re a TPG person and haven’t signed the restrictive covenants with VFO yet, continue to refuse to do so. You’re all capable of finding another job in a real hurry. so VFO needs you more than you need them.

I agree, as Revo was so dang good! Now, I don't 
have a good sollution for uninstalling things entirely automatically. Oh sure, I 
can always go to programs and features and remove it, but that doesn't mean 
necessarily that all files are deleted, and all registry entries go away. What I 
like about Revo is the fact it did all that guesswork for me, and I didn't have 
to worry about a thing. Yeah, sometimes it would screw up, let's just be fair. 
It *is* technology after all, but I'd say 90-95% of the time, it did a pretty 
good job.

A while back if you are interested i wrote up a basic tutorial on using face book and there might be a audio one as well up on my website at

http://www.accessibilitycentral.net/nvda%20tutorials%20for%20other%20programs.html
It is called how to navigate face book with nvda. When you get to the page you will need to jump down by headings to it.


In face book you also need to change between the modes to do stuff like browse mode, focus mode to see some of the pop up stuff there then change back.


I guess you would be maybe the first on the list to ask for one actually the second as when a mate asked i wrote it up then for him to use in new zealand.


Hope it helps.

I've asked for a
                                  good tutorial on using Facebook with
                                  NVDA but so far, no luck.  All anyone
                                  says is that Facebook changes their
                                  web page interface so radically and so
                                  often, that it just isn't possible to
                                  use except for Smart Phone app
                                  versions.

What I do? 



When I open my account, I click on the link Skip to

Then I click on it. It positiones me down in the

Then, I activate the focus mode. I Shift-tab a few

                tab till I come to the very link called Live video. Then
                I switch back to the browse mode, and then I press enter
                to activate it (for it fails to activate while in the

Hi friends, 



I have recently discovered that Google Chrome as a
                    browser makes it possible for us to do the live
                    streaming on facebook. I have checked IE, Mozilla

                    no avail. The link Live Video, it seems, is not
                    recognized by them.

                                  just use m.facebook.com and there is

I've asked for a
                                    good tutorial on using Facebook with
                                    NVDA but so far, no luck.  All
                                    anyone says is that Facebook changes
                                    their web page interface so
                                    radically and so often, that it just
                                    isn't possible to use except for
                                    Smart Phone app versions.

When you open your FB account, click on the link ""Skip to news

Then, press the up arrow to hear ""dialog"" pronounced. Use shift
      and tab until you hear ""Live video tab"" pronounced for you. When
      you find that tab, press enter on it to be selected. Press tab so
      that you may say something about your Live Video. Your Live Video
      Streaming server is supposed to ask you to share your camera and
      your microphone. Allow it. 



It seems that the Live Video area has been replaced, for when I
      wish to find it, I must shift-tab to find it before the What's on
      your mind area, not after it, as it was before. Besides, NVDA
      detected it as a link, not as a tab. Now that it has changed, NVDA
      reads it as a tab.

                  times till I hear ""What's on your mind"" spoken. Then I

                  Then I switch back to the browse mode, and then I
                  press enter to activate it (for it fails to activate

Hi friends, 



I have recently discovered that Google Chrome as
                      a browser makes it possible for us to do the live
                      streaming on facebook. I have checked IE, Mozilla

                      to no avail. The link Live Video, it seems, is not

                                            using Facebook with NVDA but
                                            so far, no luck.  All anyone
                                            says is that Facebook
                                            changes their web page

When you open your FB account, click on the link ""Skip to
          news feed"". 



Then, press the up arrow to hear ""dialog"" pronounced. Use
          shift and tab until you hear ""Live video tab"" pronounced for
          you. When you find that tab, press enter on it to be selected.
          Press tab so that you may say something about your Live Video.
          Your Live Video Streaming server is supposed to ask you to
          share your camera and your microphone. Allow it. 



It seems that the Live Video area has been replaced, for when
          I wish to find it, I must shift-tab to find it before the
          What's on your mind area, not after it, as it was before.
          Besides, NVDA detected it as a link, not as a tab. Now that it
          has changed, NVDA reads it as a tab.

What I do? 



When I open my account, I click on the link Skip
                      to news feed. 



Then I click on it. It positiones me down in the
                      vicinity of the Create post area. 



Then, I activate the focus mode. I Shift-tab a
                      few times till I hear ""What's on your mind""
                      spoken. Then I tab till I come to the very link
                      called Live video. Then I switch back to the
                      browse mode, and then I press enter to activate it
                      (for it fails to activate while in the focus
                      mode). Then, I go to the focus mode back again,
                      and I would tab till I hear ""Next submenu"". When I
                      click on it, a new pop-up window is opened for me.
                      It contains an option called ""Go live"". 



I hope this helps!

Hi friends, 



I have recently discovered that Google Chrome
                          as a browser makes it possible for us to do
                          the live streaming on facebook. I have checked
                          IE, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Avast Safe
                          Zone Browser, but to no avail. The link Live
                          Video, it seems, is not recognized by them. 



I hope this means something to you.

OK, this makes no sense, and I'm highly surprised 
that no one has seen it, given the fact I've reproduced it on about 6 different 
computers here, and have also had about 5 of my other friends reproduce it as 
well.
 
Ever since updating to NVDA 2017.2, my numpad 
insert key has completely stopped working as the NVDA modifier.
 
I looked in the keyboard preferences and both caps 
lock and numpad insert are checked. I've unchecked and re, checked both 
checkboxes individually as well as at the same time. I've restarted NVDA, I've 
rebooted, I've unloaded all plugins and simply reinstalled from a fresh copy 
with not a single addon running, and all default stock settings.
 
I've tried with both a portable copy, as well as a 
full installation.
 
I've converted a portable to a full install, as 
well as downloaded the setup file and installed directly with no 
success.
 
I even used Revo to remove NVDA so that no traces 
of any app data were behind. Then reinstalled. No good.
 
I've tried this on Windows 7 Home, Windows 7 Pro, 
Windows 7 Ultimate, all 3 of those, I've tried both with X86 as well as 
X64.
 
I've tried with Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 Pro, 
and even had a friend who's a college student try with Windows 10 Education. All 
of those were tested as well on both X86 and X64. This was reproduced on every 
single one of those systems 100% consistently.
 
Before anyone asks the obvious, yes, num lock was 
disabled. I'm not that far gone.
 
I looked through the diag logs and saw nothing that 
indicated what the problem was.
 
I checked for an NVDA update and found 
nothing.
 
I installed the snapshot next branch and had the 
same problem.
 
I tested with JAWS to be sure it wasn't something 
screwy in general going on with my insert key, but in JFW, it works flawlessly, 
plus the fact it's happenning on more than one system...
 
I even was so desperet, I tried with XP Pro, and 
that even was reproducible.
 
What gives!

POP is a dieing protocol that is not generally considered useful in a world with multiple devices accessing the same mail seamlessly. It makes more sense to keep the mail on the server, rather than downloading it to an individual device so it is no longer available to download on others. There are schemes involving ""leave mail on server"", and setting expiration times, and such, that make multi device support work with POP, but I've seen people get into weird situations (usually double mail) doing that sort of thing and mixing multiple email applications, so I generally wouldn't advise it.Especially since IMAP is available, and usually works seamlessly across all devices: delete it on one, it goes away from all, unless you use a trash folder or archive folder such as with gmail.But POP is not dead yet, and anything major still supports it, including iOS Mail.Luke",NVDA Still Sluggish in Thunderbird,33,64383

And, as the correct answer says:  If you are using IMAP (according to your updated question) then this is not possible. It's not how IMAP works. IMAP is designed to communicate with a central server where all your mail is stored.And, with that, I'm declaring this topic closed, as it has long ago strayed from anything directly NVDA related.   And what's been offered strongly suggests factors idiosyncratic to individual practices, not NVDA. --

doesn't teach use of ribbons in the Windows 10 interface but ribbons are 
ribbons.  Some people have problems understanding ribbons.  But most 
people learn them without too much trouble and some people learn them

I'll provide a brief tutorial based on what I wrote 
years ago of how to work with ribbons.  
 
I've added a little to it here.
 
I don't know how the organization of Windows has 
changed in Windows 10 but this description should allow you to look through the 
Windows ribbons, or any other ribbons, and see how things are organized.  

 
First, I'll discuss a structure found in later 
versions of Windows that you need to know about-- the split button.  
One thing you will see as you look around ribbons and in other places in 
Windows are split buttons. A split button often allows you to see more options 
than just the default action.  Let's take an example.  Let's say 
you come across a split button that says shut down Windows.  If you press 
enter on that button, Windows will shut down.  That is the default 
action.  Split buttons often show more options if you either right arrow 
while on the button or down arrow.  As an example, if you are on the shut 
down split button, you can right arrow and a list of options will open.  
the items in the list include sleep, hibernate, restart, and others.  You 
up or down arrow through the list or use the short cut commands you hear 
announced as you move through the list.  the letter shortcuts often take 
actions without pressing enter so be careful when using them, just as you are in 
menus.  
 
So, let's review.  You find a split button 
that says shut down.  If you press enter, the computer will shut down. If 
you right arrow, other options may be displayed.  Or if you down arrow, 
other options may be displayed.  A split button won't work with both 
methods.  One method, either right arrowing or down arrowing will do so if 
it can be done with the button.  Try both methods if you don't know which 
one might work.  If you are on a tool bar which extends across the screen 
from left to right, down arrowing will open additional options.  If you 
think about this, it makes sense.  If you are in a menu, down arrowing will 
move you to the next item in the menu.  So you right arrow on the split 
button to cause it to display more options.  In a tool bar that extends 
across the screen from left to right, right arrowing will move you to the next 
item in the tool bar.  So you down arrow when on the split button to cause 
it to display more options.  But some tool bars run up and down the screen, 
as menus do.  And at times, you may not be sure which way a structure 
extends on screen.  So, as I said, if you are not sure or don't know, try 
both methods of causing the split button to display more options.  Often, 
one of them will work. If you open the options a split button offers and don't 
want to work with them, arrow in the opposite direction to move out of 
them.  For example, if you right arrowed to open more options, left 
arrow.  Some split buttons don't do anything when you right arrow or 
down arrow.  In that case, open them with alt down arrow.  Then tab 
through the additional options.  I've almost never worked in this way with 
split buttons but if you want to close a split button, try alt up arrow if 
you've used alt down arrow to open it.
 
Now, to ribbons themselves.
 
Regarding ribbons, much of the complaining about 
them is not warranted if you understand how they work and how to use short cut 
commands effectively and efficiently.  and I would strongly recommend 
against using the JAWS virtual menus, no matter what the JAWS training material 
says about ribbons being difficult to use.  the training material is just 
plain wrong and using virtual menus, you will be unnecessarily dependent on one 
screen-reader.  There are other disadvantages to using them which I won't 
go into here.
 
Try looking at ribbons and doing what is described 
below in wordpad.  Everyone with Windows 7 has Wordpad on their 
machine.  Wordpad provides a good environment to look at and practice 
working with ribbons.   
 
The essence of working with ribbons is 
this:Press alt to move to the upper ribbon.You will probably be on an 
item that says home tab. Items on the upper ribbon are announced as tabs such as 
home tab, view tab, etc.  To see what ribbons are available, right or 
left arrow repeatedly to move through the ribbons.  Move in 
onedirection to move through all of them, just as you would to move through 
all the menus. 
 
For this demonstration, just so we are all doing 
the same thing, move with the right arrow. When you get back to where you 
started, you can keep right arrowing to move through the items again, if you 
wish.  You can move through all the items as many times as you want. Or you 
can move with the left arrow whenever you want to move in the opposite 
direction.   
 
Stop on view.  Then start tabbing.  You 
will move through all items in what is called the lower ribbon that are in the 
view ribbon.  
 
In other words you tab to see the items in a ribbon 
once you move to it.  Tab moves you forward through the items, shift tab 
moves you backword.So tab and shift tab are used instead of up and down 
arrow.  
 
Many items in the lower ribbon are buttons.  
Use either the space bar or enter to activate the button. You may find a button 
that opens a menu and if you press enter or the space bar, you will then be in a 
menu. 
 
Each time you move to an item, you will hear the 
short cut command to work with that item.  But JAWS has a bug and you 
often won't.  To hear the short cut, use the command JAWS key tab.  If 
you are using the default JAWS key, it is either insert.
 
Try tabbing to an item in a Wordpad ribbon and 
using the command insert tab.  You will hear some extraneous 
information.  The last thing you will hear is the short cut sequence.  
You can repeat the information by repeating the command as often as you 
want.
 
Let's look at an item which is usually called the 
application menu.  Return to the main program window in wordpad by closing 
the ribbons.  You can either press escape repeatedly, if necessary, or you 
can press alt once.  Now, open the ribbons again with alt.  Start 
right arrowing until you get to the application menu.You will hear 
application menu and then something like button drop down grid.  Never mind 
drop down grid.  It's a description you don't have to worry about.  
The important things are that you are on a button and at the application 
menu.  Press enter or the space bar to activate the button.  
Activating the button opens the menu.  Start down arrowing. you will hear 
all the short cut commands necessary to open an item or take an action.  
When you got to the menu item, you heard alt f.  When you open the menu and 
move through it, you will hear all the letters announced.  for example, if 
you down arrow to save as, you will hear alt f a.  that means that, when 
you are in the main program window, you open the menu as you always did, alt f, 
then type a.  Alt f opens the menau and a then opens save as.  Ribbon 
programs have one menu and you should look through it.  Many important and 
common commands and interfaces such as options may be there.  By options, I 
mean the kind of options interface you used to find in the tools 
menu.
 
Now the we have seen the menu, let's look at the 
ribbons structure some more.To review, and add more information, as you have 
seen, you can move to the ribbon interface with alt.  Then right and left 
arrow, just as you would move from menu to menu.  You can also move to 
a ribbon using alt and a letter.  So, alt h takes you to the home 
ribbon.  Alt v takes you to the view ribbon, etc.  Once you are on the 
ribbon you want to work with, tab to move forward through the items in a 
ribbon.  Shift tab to move back through the items.  So tab and shift 
tab are used instead of up and down arrow.Ribbons are divided into 
categories which you will hear announced as you tab.  for example, in an 
e-mail program, a ribbon may have a category named respond.  You may hear 
this announced as respond tool bar.  As you tab, you will hear commands 
such as reply and forward in the respond category.  When you hear a 
category announced, don't tab until you hear everything spoken.  You will 
miss the first command in the category if you do.  I'm talking about 
working with an unfamiliar ribbon.  there are often many more commands 
and items in a ribbon than in a menu.  So memorize command sequences for 
items you know you will use regularly.  As I said, there are different 
categories in ribbons to help organize items.  You can quickly jump from 
category to category in a ribbon to help you see if there is a category you want 
to look through.  Move to a ribbon in Wordpad.  For example, alt h 
for hhome or alt v for view.Then repeatedly issue the command control right 
arrow to move forward from category to category and control left arrow to move 
back.  When you get to a category you want to hear the items in, start 
tabbing.  Of course, you can shift tab to move back.  
 
Open a ribbon in Wordpad and tab through it to see 
how it is organized by moving through it.  Then use control right arrow 
to move by category and tab to see what is in a category.  
 
Commands such as control o, control n, control s, 
control r, etc. are mostly retained in programsthat use ribbons, though you 
won't hear them announced. If you don't already know them, you'll have to find 
them in ways such as by looking at a list of keyboard commands for the 
program.  Such lists are often available in the help for the program. If 
you already know the commands from having used an older version of the program, 
most or perhaps even all of the commands you know will work.",NVDA and ribbon menues,33,49974

Uh, yes, it is.   If you think that Microsoft, or any software maker, that's been using the same UI for over a decade is going to change it because some small minority hates it then I have some oceanfront property in Omaha to offer you.Don Quixote showed more common sense than those that still rail against the ribbon interface rather than learning how to use it.  It's just a menu that works slightly differently.And this is coming from someone who did, and still does, like conventional menus better.  I just know that the ribbon ship sailed, and sailed long ago. --

discussion and account for the fact that I read perhaps thirty messages in the 
thread and no one objects to ribbons.  Microsoft is changing the design of 
ribbons in the Office Suite.  They are simplifying them in some way.  
In this discussion, some people don't like the change, some people think it 
should be optional and some people like it.  But in all the messages I 
read, not one person objected to ribbons themselves.
 
Also, people are more likely to complain if they 
dislike something.  Of course some people don't like ribbons, but your 
sample, some friends or people you know, isn't eeven remotely a proper survey 
from which to draw such conclusions.  
 
I assume by saying it is hated, and it was hated 
that you mean most people hate ribbons.  That is not a properly supported 
statement.
https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365/Outlook-365-Ribbon-etc/td-p/267706
 
Also, a lot of other programs are nowhere nearly as 
complex as the programs in the Office Suite.  So, since people don't like 
change and since there isn't much benefit to switching to ribbons this wasn't 
done.  You don't know what might have happened if most programs were this 
complex.  The ribbon allows the user to see a lot more items much more 
quickly and efficiently.  So your argument about other programs not 
adopting ribbons is not properly supported as to why this is the case.  
More simple programs don't benefit and why change something when there is 
no benefit are much better explanations than a putative universal or nearly 
universal hatred of ribbons.
 
I'm saying they are much better explanations 
without proper evidence supporting any conclusion.  If you can find proper 
good supporting evidence for your assertion, that's different but as of now, 
your statements are unsupported and appear to be incorrect.

I guess it's reasonable to assume that's what Gene meant to say.However, regarding praise versus criticism, your point that ""most people say little to nothing at all if everything is 'just fine as it is but isn't exceptional in any way'"" is all well and good, but I think it's just as true to say that ""most people say little to nothing at all if everything is 'not very good but isn't particularly bad in any way'"".In other words, if things are more or less acceptable; only just a bit better or worse than people expect, would like, or are used to, then they won't say much, if anything.But I do think that people praise improvements just as much as they complain about things getting worse.  Internet support forums are not the place to look for that praise, however - and the clue is in the name - people don't look for support when they like what they have; they look for support when they have a problem.Praise is for more likely to go directly back to the suppliers / developers, so aside from the ""satisfied customer"" quotes you see on a lot of websites, such comments simply don't get publicised on the Internet to the same extent that the complaints on public forums do.None of this means it's okay to ignore the people who are saying ""this is a change for the worse"", though.

what one person thinks.  But I'm not going off on you to go off on

There needs to be a balance that will let people know that ribbons are being 
used successfully by a lot of blind people so that the negative comments don't 
discourage learning.  That's why I argue with Brian.  As one person, 
he may think whatever he likes and I wouldn't keep discussing it.  But 
messages discussing how bad or difficult to use something is on a large list may 
discourage use and a lot of blind people are already very disposed against 
ribbons and don't want to try them.

I have no idea why you'd argue with me about this.  I favor, and strongly, people learning to use the ribbon interface because it is not going away.  It is the de facto interface in huge swaths of Windows dating back to 2007.My noting that I have heard a lot of people, and particularly on blind and low vision lists, complain about ribbons is a simple statement of fact.  Each and every time I respond with useful information on learning to use them and emphasizing that no amount of whining is going to make them go away.  That ship, as I noted earlier, has sailed. --

15377,Damien Garwood,2017-02-23 14:13:07.124630341,"Hi there,
I have a few comments, suggestions, questions etc.
1. Whenever 
I type anything into the Run dialog that has anything to do with NVDA, NVDA 
itself attempts to run.
This is a 
difficult one to comment on – that can be extremely helpful if NVDA has crashed, 
or you’re trying to revive your screenreader after some other mishap. However it 
also means I can’t enter any websites that have anything to do with NVDA in the 
address.
I do tend 
to access most things from the run dialog, as it’s a simple process of Win+R, 
type, enter, rather than having to browse for a program through explorer. Could 
this possibly be fixed so that a URL will take you to the appropriate 
place?
2. Profiles 
have a tendancy to use all settings, when you might want to keep some of the 
global settings active. For instance, if a profile is running and I change the 
audio output, as soon as that profile is deactivated the audio reverts back when 
chances are I want it to stay. Again, difficult to comment on, since not sure 
how it would be possible to have an option for any or every setting to stay 
global for a profile etc.
3. Even if 
no profiles are used, if you change the audio device, tones played by NVDA (for 
instance indentation, progress bars etc) don’t take this change into account 
until NVDA is restarted. I’m assuming this is a bug.
4. I have 
replaced the default NVDA sounds and would prefer it to retain my sounds after 
an update if at all possible. I do understand why the original sounds folder is 
reverted (it probably sees the sounds in its own package as being part of the 
upgrade, or perhaps it simply replaces every file in case of other conflicts), 
but perhaps a soundscheme setting or a user sounds folder could be a 
possibility?
5. This is 
perhaps the most important – NVDA seems to have a tendancy to miss labels and 
static texts that other screenreaders have no problems finding. I myself noticed 
a change in a program I used to use quite regularly when switching to NVDA a few 
years ago, and I’m finding more and more programs that I’m downloading or using 
simply saying “edit”, “list”, “button” etc without giving any indication as to 
what these controls are trying to tell me. This also goes for some webpages, 
where labels can and often are attached to the control they are referencing. 
Some treeviews also seem unaware of their items names, statuses etc, saying 
“Unknown” for every node and no indication as to whether it has subitems etc. 
When these kinds of things crop up I am automatically assuming that these are 
application-specific accessibility issues, but when I’m seeing this behaviour 
for multiple applications and people with other screenreaders are using them 
with no issues it does make me wonder if NVDA has some issues somewhere. 
Granted, NVDA works well with a lot of applications, but I’m wondering whether 
it has internal support for most of these? Does every application ideally need 
an app module for optimal accessibility?

15378,Gene,2017-02-23 14:34:10.536442699,"Your discussion of the run dialog behavior doesn't 
match my test and it doesn't sound like expected behavior.  Type a full 
Internet Address, http:sitename dot com, org etc.  What you are discussing 
is Windows behavior and not related to NVDA.  Also, if you are mostly using 
the run dialog and are neglecting the start menu search and also not making 
shortcuts and assigning short cut commands to run applications, you are 
overlooking major sources of convenience, often considerably more convenient 
than using the run dialog.

15384,Damien Garwood,2017-02-23 15:55:10.308949963,"Hi Gene,
To be honest, I’ve never liked the start menu, or the desktop. If you have 
tons and tons of things installed you often find they can be far too cluttered. 
I would rather type a filename, and possibly a path if the appropriate 
environment variables haven’t been set, than go through 350 shortcuts to find 
what I’m looking for.
Even back in the XP days when there was no menu search facility, I 
preferred the Run method, though sometimes if I knew exactly what I was looking 
for and I was sure I could get to it quickly (such as start, s, enter for 
Skype), I would use the start menu. But ever since the start menu changed in 
Vista, I never touched it again. Far, far too cluttered, and in my experience, 
the search feature was completely useless, hence the reason I’ve removed it from 
the Windows Features. It’s completely gone downhill.
Again though. Each to their own. I can certainly understand the appeal if 
you know there are only a select few programs you use on a regular basis and you 
do a shortcut cleanup, but I run what I need, when I need, and can’t say for 
certain that I use anything more than the other.
Especially now I’m starting on mainstream software development toolkits I’m 
becoming more and more familiar with the command line every day, so the run 
dialog seems trivial now, in comparison. I also find that the path environment 
variable and symbolic links are also rather helpful. They take a bit of grasping 
and setting up, but I so love Win+R, docs, enter to get to the My Documents 
folder!
Cheers.Damien.",Questions and suggestions,33,15378
15386,Gene,2017-02-23 16:34:14.823899598,"I don't know what you know and, as I said, I don't 
want to assume.  I have written this somewhat long message in case you 
don't know some of what I'm discussing.  Others can provide discussions of 
good instructional material, if you wish.  If you already know what I've 
explained here, then this message won't tell you anything new but I'd rather 
discuss these matters than not so you and others following the thread will have 
the information if interested..  
 
I don't know how much you know about efficient 
navigation in Windows structures.  You don't have to go through item after 
item.  There's first letter navigation.  And if you have six items on 
the desktop that begin with the letter n, you can type more of the name of the 
item.  For example, typing nv will take you to the NVDA icon.  You 
don't just have to type the first letter.  In the all programs list, you 
can use first letter navigation but you can't type more than one letter as I 
recall. My recollection is that what I'm calling the all programs list is 
technically a menu.  The desktop is a list.  
 
In menus, only the designated letter will move you 
to the item.  In a list, typing the first letter or more will either move 
you to it or will move you to items that begin with the letter or letters.  
Often, in menus, it's the first letter but this can't be assumed.  I 
believe that in the all programs menu, it's always the first letter of the 
item.
 
When using the start menu search field, you can 
often just type one word to get to something if you do a bit of experimentation 
to figure out what that is.  I can get immediately to Windows Live Mail by 
just typing the word mail.  The other words, typing either Windows or the 
word live brings up too many results to be efficient.  
 
Do you know how to create shortcuts and to use 
shortcuts, already existing or created by you, to assign short cut commands 
to?  I have assigned the command control alt m to open Mozilla 
Firefox.  I can use that command almost anywhere to open it.  I can 
use the command control alt w to open Windows Live Mail.  And I have lots 
more.  Some people like short cuts more than others but if you don't know 
about them and try them, you are overlooking one of the fastest and most 
convenient ways to open items in Windows. 
 
And short cut commands can be used to open more 
than programs.  They can be used to open drives or you can open 
a folder or a file you use constantly or a great deal just by issuing one 
command. 
 
Not everything I've said may apply in Windows 10, I 
don't know.  I don't use Windows 10.  But most of it will, or will 
with slight modifications.  And that is true of Windows 8 as well.  

 
I'm not trying to be didactic or dictatorial but I 
hope that if you don't know the things I've been discussing, that you get some 
good instructional material.  Windows is very convenient and efficient when 
used as designed.  It isn't when used as though it were something else, 
like DOS.

Hotkeys are indeed excellent. One of the first thing I look for in a 
program is hotkeys. In fact, some have so many that it’s hard to memorise all of 
them. But at least they’re there!
The only problem I have with Windows shortcuts being linked to them is 
that, because they are global throughout the whole system, it can unfortunately 
cause conflicts with other running applications that utilise those shortcuts. 
For instance, I could assign a ctrl+alt+q shortcut to launch QWS (a MIDI 
sequencer), and another application may use ctrl+alt+q to mean quit. I have 
known ctrl+alt+o for options, ctrl+alt+x for exit, ctrl+alt+n/p for 
next/previous, all of which can be assigned to a Windows hotkey, and then it’s 
touch and go as to which item activates. Otherwise, I’m definitely all for 
hotkeys!
As an aside, I must admit I do find it odd, and mildly frustrating that 
there are four modifier keys that can be used to register hotkeys and yet it is 
still possible to run out of logical keys! This is even more so for global 
shortcut-linked ones, since I think you can only have ctrl+alt and ctrl+shift 
combos. Possibly if you’re extremely dextrous you might be able to have 
ctrl+shift+alt, I haven’t dared to try that one. Lol.
First letter navigation. Now you mention it I am aware of it. I use it all 
the time to move quickly to files in Explorer. But for some reason it didn’t 
cross my mind for the desktop (even though I know that is also controlled by 
explorer). I guess because my explorer is in detail view, and the desktop shows 
as a sort of grid layout I treated them as two separate systems. Strange how

      arguing that other screen readers provide another keystroke for

Good lord, if folks wanted every single windows function
      duplicated, just imagine how much bloat screen readers would
      have.  Nothing wrong with leaving windows keystrokes alone, and
      just pointing them out when someone asks.  No need to needlessly

      just fine? 

Give it a rest already.

That isn't the reason and that argument is irrelevant.  The
        system tray wasn't accessible years ago through Windows.  There
        needed to be a screen-reader dialog to provide access.  That's
        how the whole separate access got started and System Access uses
        the same command.  Window-eyes uses a different command but it
        too provides a system tray dialog.  
 
There are times, like it or not, when the dialog works better
        than using the Windows access method and it should be provided
        as a part of screen-readers.  
 
Sometimes, I get access to something using the Windows method
        when the dialog doesn't work properly and at other times, I have
        found the only way I've gotten access to an item is by using the
        dialog.  These instances where one or the other method doesn't
        work are rare but the argument that the screen-reader dialog
        method is nothing but duplication is not correct.

Because NVDA is not jaws, and there's no reason to make it
        mirror jaws keystrokes.  The windows-b keystroke will work no
        matter what you use for a screen reader, since it's a windows
        command.  That's why NVDA uses it.  There is no dedicated NVDA
        keystroke for this function.

Hi Gene,


Hotkeys are indeed excellent.
                    One of the first thing I look for in a program is
                    hotkeys. In fact, some have so many that it’s hard
                    to memorise all of them. But at least they’re there!


The only problem I have with
                    Windows shortcuts being linked to them is that,
                    because they are global throughout the whole system,
                    it can unfortunately cause conflicts with other
                    running applications that utilise those shortcuts.
                    For instance, I could assign a ctrl+alt+q shortcut
                    to launch QWS (a MIDI sequencer), and another
                    application may use ctrl+alt+q to mean quit. I have
                    known ctrl+alt+o for options, ctrl+alt+x for exit,
                    ctrl+alt+n/p for next/previous, all of which can be
                    assigned to a Windows hotkey, and then it’s touch
                    and go as to which item activates. Otherwise, I’m
                    definitely all for hotkeys!


As an aside, I must admit I
                    do find it odd, and mildly frustrating that there
                    are four modifier keys that can be used to register
                    hotkeys and yet it is still possible to run out of
                    logical keys! This is even more so for global
                    shortcut-linked ones, since I think you can only
                    have ctrl+alt and ctrl+shift combos. Possibly if
                    you’re extremely dextrous you might be able to have
                    ctrl+shift+alt, I haven’t dared to try that one.
                    Lol.


First letter navigation. Now
                    you mention it I am aware of it. I use it all the
                    time to move quickly to files in Explorer. But for
                    some reason it didn’t cross my mind for the desktop
                    (even though I know that is also controlled by
                    explorer). I guess because my explorer is in detail
                    view, and the desktop shows as a sort of grid layout
                    I treated them as two separate systems. Strange how
                    brains work!


Cheers.
                    Damien.

As I said, this has already been hashed to death, 
and it's obvious that the NVDA developers will continue to ignore the request of 
some of us users, including a current moderator on this list, so I see no need 
to respond to your specific inquiries as Gene already addressed them in an 
earlier message, especially the fallibility of the erroneous belief that the 
Windows command always accesses everything it should. The add-on usually does a 
better job than the Win+b command, and whatever Jaws uses does the best job of 
all.

15535,Gene,2017-02-25 07:51:48.407309288,"For years, the only way blind people could get to 
the system tray was with the screen-reader dialog.  It became so well 
entrenched and so expected a way to reach it that it should be included in 
screen-readers.  Whether it is duplicative or not, at times in this and 
other contexts, technology related or not, a practice is so well entrenched that 
it may be desirable to continue it whether it is duplicative or not.  

 
Sighted people have constant and unnecessary 
instructions on how to do things.  How many obvious buttons on machines, 
for example, have something completely unnecessary written as a prompt such as 
push.  What else are you going to do with a button on a machine? Why 
is there so much opposition to, not as a general practice, but in this one 
instance, making things a gbit easier for a lot of NVDA users while doing no 
harm? 

 
And at very rare times, I have found it necessary to have 
the dialog available.  As I said yesterday, I've seen very rare instances 
where you can't work with an icon except in the screen-reader provided system 
tray dialog.
 
Furthermore, to work with the 
Windows implementation, you need to know commands most blind computer users 
don't know.  Enter equals left double click in the system tray.  Space 
bar equals left single click.  The context menu key equals right 
click.  Since even a lot of experienced computer users don't know such 
commands implementing a system tray dialog will eliminate frustration and 
problems that will occur without knowing them.  And, unless this has been 
changed, these commands are not covered in the NVDA users' guide.  And how 
many people read manuals with any thoroughness?  And finally, when using 
the system tray directly, you don't up and down arrow through icons.  You 
right or left arrow.  The commands I've given and the difference in 
movement commands can easily be explained.  But most users are not on lists 
such as this, probably don't read the user Guide with the kind of thoroughness 
that would allow them to discover such commands and, as I said, unless this has 
changed, these things aren't discussed in the users Guide.  The Windows 
command is given at some point, but I don't think any of what I have discussed 
other than that is provided.

This is possible because a separatestructure for certain group of settings is given. The advantage is that youdon't have to search one hour to find the settings you would like to change.However, I would make it even easier by enhancing the settings ring. Withctrl+shift+nvda+arrow keys you can change several settings without having toaccess the menu. In my view this should be the priority in the future,because in fact I want to change settings without changing the window I amcurrently working in. For example if I am in a browser and access the menu,the cursor position gets often lost and I have to find my position againafter closing the menu. By adding new settings features to the ring wouldsolve this problem. For example it would help a lot if we could change thekeyboard layout out of the ring instead going into the menu. An other usefulfeature would be to integrate document formatting to the ring as well.Why document formatting in the ring? Well, often people want to hear justone formatting feature, for example colors or font. It would be muchintuitive to change between formating elements out of the ring and to go tothe menu just when you need more information at the same time.Another nice ring feature would be to change colors. Say we have an excelsheet and we are told to type something just in the yellow cells. Assume wehave in the ring a cathegory ""say color"". You could change say color toyellow out of the ring and in the menu you could atrubute a key to thebrowse mode (for example y) to jump between yellow cells. You could let y tobe the standard key for every color you choose from the ""say color""cathegory. If you want NVDA to say all colors, than you go through the ringto document formatting and change to colors. In that case NVDA would say allcolors and y would still navigate you through the color which you chose inthe ""say color"" section of the ring. This could also work for other formatting features like type (areal, timenew roman etc) or font (bold, italic etc.).

Someone wrote in the Romanian community that NVDA does lag when he's typing something. I told him to return to the default configuration and this worked for him But, another person contacted me privately to ttell me that NVDA has a strange behavior. When navigating on Skype or browsers with tab, it says ""unknown"" instead of reading the content. He reseted the configuration, uninstalled the add-ons, restarted NVDA several times, but no result. I told him to reinstall NVDA.
So, a repair option is required in this case. As I remember, JAWS has this option in the installation wizard. I haven't used it for a long time.

haven't upgraded my Windows 7 computer is because I want to control it, not cede 
control of it to Microsoft.  While there are arguments that can be made 
that people benefit in general by having forced updates, and maybe people in 
general do, that doesn't mean that I do as an individual and especially as an

be forced.  Other updates that aren't really necessary, should not 
be.  
 
At some point, when I buy a new computer, igt will

gives me no problems that amount to anything and maybe have new and

What I personally do not want is for programs such as Outlook express to be dropped as app modules. I and others value being able to use it in later windows and although live mail is also a dead thing, many use it successfully and it borrows a lot from Outlook express.So I'm saying don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. In my view, the code overhead is probably worth it, and also in a program as complex as nvda, many unexpected issues will suddenly pop out of the woodwork as the assumption that a piece of code is redundant, might actually not be true. Look at the  library that was removed when you did away with the nvda Service for example. its tiny as code but may well be there for a reason.Many of us use older software on newer systems, particularly windows 7 as it is enough like xp to cooperate well with them, or be easy to patch.I think its easy for people in the development side of a piece of software to accidentally fall into the elitist trenches, when in fact there is no need to go down that route as there are enough challenges going on trying to keep up with Microsofts changes as it is. Focus on those and keeping it reliable, leave removing bits until there is a quiet period or the reliability might be jeopardised. in my view.

    problem here is that if you setup your email account into third
    party program like the one she used in android , thunderbird and the

And it's not really intended to be read, in the conventional sense of the word.  It's the graphical representation of a sound sequence as close to ""literally"" as you can get it.  When you ""read"" something in IPA you're not conventionally reading it like text but creating a sound stream of phonemes based on their IPA symbols.  It's certainly nothing like reading any natural language that has a written form (sign language being one of the natural languages that has no written form, and there are others). --

Well, and not for the purpose of being nasty or contrary, nothing could be further from the truth.This is a particular instance where no matter what the accessibility workaround it is taking a medium meant to be accessed by sight, really only accessed by sight, that is a transcription of sound.  It is particularly and peculiarly unsuited to any methods currently known and the only thing I can think of would be if one could get a synthesizer to read the IPA graphemes as phonemes, one-by-one, and even that doesn't come close to connected speech.I have said, on many occasions, that sometimes there is no substitute for sight and that all accessibility is a workaround which imposes specific limitations not posed by media being ""consumed"" in the sensory modality for which it was explicitly designed. --

The only difference is that there are much more letters; therefore, we need someone patient enough to go through all of them and give them either names or unique descriptions. Our screen readers either go through those symbols by being totally silent, or they read only the base-letter; not very helpful. This might be difficult to understand for someone who never encountered IPA before, but it should be much easier to implement than, for example, music notation.

If you want my serious recommendation it would be to have a sit-down with your department head, and any other faculty in your program, and ask them their opinion as to a path through a linguistics degree, particularly an advanced one, without
 phonetic transcription being a big part of it.

I have to believe there is a path through, though I would imagine it would involve a specifically designed undergraduate path as well as a clear idea as to what your graduate focus will be and that it not involve phonetics (transcription directly, not an understanding
 of, which of course you'll have).

They are in a far better place to give you informed opinion, and the direct assistance with program design that you'll need, than I can.  There's nothing wrong with reasonable accommodations in academic pursuit, particularly if your desired area of specialty

I did, when it was mentioned by someone else on the JAWS group, in a topic to which I gave the direct link.There is a difference between possible to create a way for a screen reader to do a character by character IPA reading, and same being practical for extensive use.  Just because something can be done, and indeed it seems has been done, doesn't make it good advice to say, ""Hey, this is a reasonable area to try to delve into with circumstances being what they are.""I would not discourage anyone who's blind from the study of phonetics, which is entirely possible without ever doing a single character of phonetic transcription (which is a poor substitute for actual recordings).  I would strongly discourage trying to delve into phonetic transcription, or the reading of same, due to the constraints I've mentioned previously.  Practicality does, and should, play a role.The study of linguistics requires a knowledge of phonetics and phonetic theories.  It really doesn't require the ability to do phonetic transcription, nor even to read it well, as many ditch it after an introductory course if their chosen area really doesn't require it.But, at this point, we've really strayed from even tangential relationship to NVDA in any meaningful sense. --

another aspect of the current situation in this rather long 
message.
 
If people want to use sounds, there is nothing 
wrong with that but you don't need them and my position is that being so 
dependent on them that you make that a major determining factor on what browser 
to use is being too dependent.  That's my position.  I didn't say they 
are worthless nor that people shouldn't use them.  I'm talking about being 
too dependent on one aspect of a program when that aspect isn't central to the 
program and when there may be better programs in general that don't have this 
specific characteristic.
I'm saying that if someone considers sounds in 
browsers to be so important that that is a major factor in deciding what browser 
to use, I consider that to be too dependent.  There are other efficient 
ways to tell things when using a browser.  If a page hasn't loaded, you 
can't move around.  Tabbing or down arrowing once or twice will tell 
you.  I'm not saying, as you said, that they are pointless.  I'm 
saying that almost anything sounds do, can be either efficiently inferred or 
checked by other methods and that changing from one browser to another based 
either only or largely on sounds, is making this one characteristic of a browser 
too important.  
 

I don't want my position to be misunderstood.  If 
people want to use sounds, then that's fine;  I'm saying that dependence on 
them to an excessive degree is not desirable if it leads to decisions on what 
programs to use in a certain class when trying to decide between program a and b 
that do roughly the same thing.  Browsers have various advantages and 
disadvantages and sound is only one aspect of a program.  

Also, the changes being made in 
firefox, according to a review I've read, make it even faster than Chrome.  
It isn't much faster, at least now, and I don't think it matters but if people 
read the article about these changes posted last week from Marco's Accessibility 
blog, these changes may result in screen-readers being far more capable to work 
on complex pages that have embedded programs or where the pages are far more 
interactive than traditional web pages, and that increasing numbers of web pages 
are, and will be more complex over time.  Therefore, I find the attitude of 
blaming Mozilla for what it says it intends to be only a temporary loss of 
performance for blind users, and writing as though they are going to permanently 
use a different browser without even seeing the results of the work being done 
is disturbing.  At the moment, Chrome may be better than Firefoxs in its 
latest version because of the changes.  But blind people may be better 
served by what Mozilla is doing after the initial inconvenience.  

 
How often do sighted people 
complain about things like road construction and repair, but would they never 
use the road again because of the temporary inconvenience?  They may use a 
different road during the repairs and the road may even be closed at times, but 
they return to it when it is in good order again.

Well said, Gene, and something that could be 
applied to other areas of life that would become off topic here.
Do I use Firefox with the navigational sounds 
extension? Yes.
Would I miss it if it truly became out of date? Yes.
Would I hope it would come back? Yes.
If not, would I see if another one existed? Yes.
Would I cry about it and go boo hoo? No.
Would I quit using Firefox if I couldn't find a replacement, or a working 
alternative? No.
For me, the navigational sounds are a convenience, not a necessity. 
After all, I do use Chrome on occasion, and have not found a sounds extention, 
nor have I really searched that hard as my Chrome usage pales next to my Firefox 
usage, and I wouldn't die if I didn't find one.

But the statement from Mozilla, reproduced in 
Marco's Accessibility Blog, makes it 
clear that many changes are to deal efficiently with web pages that are 
increasingly interactive and complex.  An important reason changes are 
being made regarding accessibility is because of the changes in web page design 
that have and are occurring as the Internet takes on more complex 
functions.  Indeed, it looks to me as though Chrome will have to do the 
same sorts of things at some point and that one reason Edge was inaccessible 
after its release is because these sorts of changes are already built into the 
browser, although someone who knows more than my very slight bit of reading on

If people want to use sounds, there is nothing wrong with that but youdon't need them and my position is that being so dependent on them that youmake that a major determining factor on what browser to use is being toodependent.  That's my position.  I didn't say they are worthless nor thatpeople shouldn't use them.  I'm talking about being too dependent on oneaspect of a program when that aspect isn't central to the program and whenthere may be better programs in general that don't have this specificcharacteristic.

There are other efficient ways to tell things whenusing a browser.  If a page hasn't loaded, you can't move around.  Tabbingor down arrowing once or twice will tell you.  I'm not saying, as you said,that they are pointless.  I'm saying that almost anything sounds do, can beeither efficiently inferred or checked by other methods and that changingfrom one browser to another based either only or largely on sounds, ismaking this one characteristic of a browser too important.  I don't want my position to be misunderstood.

Well the beta I tried simply refused to say anything but unknown on any  page, though most of the menus still worked.  I'm not inclined to update since I use the sound, particularly the onewhen  a page has fully loaded and the one that tells me a link has in fact  activated and of course download complete  I have seen elsewhere where people think these sounds are pointless. I  dispute this as everyone is different and I really only use browsers whereI  can actually hear that things are going on. for example I've alwaysnoticed  that screenreaders sometimes do not figure out the page has loaded, but  navigational sounds does and hence allows me to re focus thescreenreader.   Also I would not know if a download had completed if the download panewas  hidden without a sound.   Some links click but clickables do not so sometimes you can figure outwhat  is which sort of link on a page this way. In a way it would be even better  if button link and clickable had different sounds to save one getting  confused.  I think the list of things some of us want in a browser is obviously going  to be different to what the sighted want, so one will really need somebody  at Mozilla etc to write blind specific add ons for a browser.   Its far easier when trying to teach somebody how to use a browser to be  able to say, if you do not hear x then its not worked.   Brian  bglists@...  Sent via blueyonder.

You opine that if browser makers knew whatwe needed access to, they could give us that, and then screen readerswouldn't have to do this unsecure stuff. Yeah, I agree with that, and sodo the folks at Mozilla. Here's somebody claiming screen readers shoulddo exactly what you said they should, again, since you apparently didn'tread it the first time.https://www.marcozehe.de/2017/09/29/rethinking-web-accessibility-on-windows/That's literally exactly what you just said, the browser gives thescreen reader the information it needs. Do you think such a change willhappen instantaneously or something? You then further opine aboutprotecting idiots from ""their own bad practices"". Sure, it's possiblethat somebody could do the classic click on a link from an email andsuffer a code injection attack. But the more problematic thing hasnothing whatsoever to do with anybody's ""bad practices"".It goes like this. I think to myself, ""self, let's go check the news"".So I fire up my trusty browser and go to CNN or the BBC or wherever thehell people go for news these days. Oh look! Suddenly my browser'sfreaking out and I just had financial information stolen from my system.Surely I was the idiot for going to the CNN, right? Nope, because thatsite got hacked, I had no way of knowing that, and I got hit with a codeinjection attack. That's precisely the sort of thing the new Firefox istrying to have better security against.By your reasoning, I should turn off any antivirus programs I'm runningand go to any website I please, however bad it might look, becauseyou're never going to have perfect security, so why even bother? I getthat it's really frustrating that the new Firefox doesn't work for you,I really do. But that doesn't change the fact that A., Firefox is moresecure, and B., they're literally trying to do exactly what you saidthey should do in terms of accessibility, figure out what a screenreader needs and giving it access to that information. I mean like theyare literally saying ""we know this might break some things for a bit,but we really are trying to get to better security and betteraccessibility in the end, so please be patient with us"".And you literally agree with what they're intending to do when it comesto providing accessibility, because you said it's what they should havebeen doing in the first place. So why in the world are you doing nothingbut complaining, now that they're saying they have the stuff they needto create this better form of accessibility, and they're starting to doso? Because again, BOTH major screen readers warned everybody in advanceand gave an accessible version of the exact same browser to use. Plus aspeople on this list have mentioned and experimented with, we've got twoother largely accessible browsers at our immediate disposal.They're literally trying to make the changes you claim they should make,and all you've been doing for the last two or three weeks is complainingabout it. They are actually trying to do the thing you think is betterfor us, and all you've been doing is pissing and moaning about how we'resecond class citizens and nobody cares about us poor poor blind folks!And yes, I know I'm running this into the ground, but it's for a reason.This is something that, however immediately painful, and it shouldn't bethat painful because you have browser choices, is something that'sintended to make the browser better for everybody, and yes that includesus. Not only are they saying there's now a better way to doaccessibility and we're going to do that, you agree with them and thinkit's the way they should have been using all along.They couldn't, and now they can, so that's what they want to do, and itwill be, again, better for everybody. I mean it is literally the exactopposite of treating us as second class citizens, it's saying we have atechnology we didn't have, it's better for you, give us some time toimplement it. The whole point is that we'll get improved accessibility.How in the world is that giving us ""the last dregs of the cup of tea""?I'm sorry if this comes off like I'm picking on you or attacking you,I'm honestly not trying to do that. I'm just honestly baffled. We've hadthe reasons in front of us for about the past month about how this willimprove both accessibility and security, that's the end-game they'retrying to reach. So I just do not comprehend the whole ""everybody hatesus and ignores us and we're second class citizens and I guess we'relucky to have anything at all no no squire a stale crust of bread willbe fine for my single daily meal!"" vibe you've got going on here. Hadthe security change been made and then we had no mention ofaccessibility whatsoever, I'd kind of see your point I guess. But that'sjust not what happened at all.

Boy,this is stunning. I have had no problems of any significance
      with Firefox 57.  Yet I have no doubt that a good number of people
      are having issues.  I wonder if system information comparison
      would help at all.  That is to say: if everyone shared their
      system information with Mozilla or some other tech savvy group to
      see just what factors might be involved in such widely varying
      results.

I don't know whether you are using the 64 or 32 bit version
          but if you were to use the 32 bit version or the 32 bit
          version portable, I'm not sure if there is even a 64 bit
          version portable, you could probably get it to work, though
          we'll have to see if you try it.

Even that! isn't working here. The only screen reader I've
          kind of gotten to work with it was Narrator, and even then, it
          wasn't pretty.

Regarding working with the new version of Firefox in
            Windows 7, I'm not interested in evaluating the new version
            enough to test it on a lot of web pages and in a lot of
            different tasks such as playing audio. It works here on my
            Windows 7 machine.  the main problem I found is that, when a
            page loads, I have to tab when the page should be loaded in
            order to have whatever needs to happen for the browser or
            screen-reader or whatever the case, to see anything on the
            page.  If I tab and wait a number of seconds after the page
            appears to have loaded, it then works with the
            screen-reader.  Before that, it appears blank, except that
            the title bar shows the page that is, or that is being
            loaded after the passage of a little time since I issue the
            open command.  I don't know what would happen if I tabbed
            earlier or much earlier, but I've been waiting until I hear
            NVDA announce the title bar announcing the title of the new
            page.  Others may want to experiment with shorter intervals.

I was clarifying my position because I wasn't sure it was
            stated as clearly as it should have been or if it was being
            understood as well as it should have been.  And I think
            despite you evidently disagreeing, that the underlying
            poingt is worth considering.  Excessive dependence on
            optional features may lead to problems in certain contexts. 
            If its your computer, you can set it up as you wish.  If
            it's a friends computer or a work computer, or a library
            computer, you may not be able to and excessive dependence
            can make it harder to do things in various contexts than
            otherwise.

          There are some sounds that are important because you can't get
          information 
          efficiently about something such as a USB connection in other
          ways.  I may 
          not have made it as clear as I should have in my first
          message, but I'm 
          talking specifically about sounds in contexts such as browser
          sounds, where 
          the information can be efficiently gotten in other ways. 
          There are 
          advantages and disadvantages in various browsers but making
          whether sounds 
          are available in a browser be a very important factor in
          determining whether 
          to use that browser is, in my opinion, emphasizing sounds that
          are optional 
          to a far more central position than they should be.

                      I think that the reason that some blind people
          like sounds is it 
          gives us a indacation of what's going on just like the sighted
          can see at 
          glance.  It's like windows sounds.  We have the windows music
          to let us know 
          that our computer is on.  We have other windows sounds like
          the sound we 
          hear when we plug a thumbdrive in or unplug it.  If we did not
          hear this 
          sound we would think that there is a problem but if there was
          no sound then 
          how would we know that there was a problem.  Sounds may not be
          necessary but 
          they can really help us greatly to know what is happening.  I
          don't have my 
          sounds on in my webie brouser but I would not fault somone if
          they did.  I 
          do think that it's important to a sound for down loads because
          if there is a 
          problem with your internet connection then you would know. 
          Again the 
          sighted can just look but we can't.  Alot of people don't have
          good internet 
          and it can and does loose connection quite frequently.

            I want to make my position clear and discuss another aspect
          of the current 
          situation in this rather long message.

            If people want to use sounds, there is nothing wrong with
          that but you 
          don't need them and my position is that being so dependent on
          them that you 
          make that a major determining factor on what browser to use is
          being too 
          dependent.  That's my position.  I didn't say they are
          worthless nor that 
          people shouldn't use them.  I'm talking about being too
          dependent on one 
          aspect of a program when that aspect isn't central to the
          program and when 
          there may be better programs in general that don't have this
          specific 
          characteristic.
            I'm saying that if someone considers sounds in browsers to
          be so important 
          that that is a major factor in deciding what browser to use, I
          consider that 
          to be too dependent.  There are other efficient ways to tell
          things when 
          using a browser.  If a page hasn't loaded, you can't move
          around.  Tabbing 
          or down arrowing once or twice will tell you.  I'm not saying,
          as you said, 
          that they are pointless.  I'm saying that almost anything
          sounds do, can be 
          either efficiently inferred or checked by other methods and
          that changing 
          from one browser to another based either only or largely on
          sounds, is 
          making this one characteristic of a browser too important.

            I don't want my position to be misunderstood.  If people
          want to use 
          sounds, then that's fine;  I'm saying that dependence on them
          to an 
          excessive degree is not desirable if it leads to decisions on
          what programs 
          to use in a certain class when trying to decide between
          program a and b that 
          do roughly the same thing.  Browsers have various advantages
          and 
          disadvantages and sound is only one aspect of a program.
            Also, the changes being made in firefox, according to a
          review I've read, 
          make it even faster than Chrome.  It isn't much faster, at
          least now, and I 
          don't think it matters but if people read the article about
          these changes 
          posted last week from Marco's Accessibility blog, these
          changes may result 
          in screen-readers being far more capable to work on complex
          pages that have 
          embedded programs or where the pages are far more interactive
          than 
          traditional web pages, and that increasing numbers of web
          pages are, and 
          will be more complex over time.  Therefore, I find the
          attitude of blaming 
          Mozilla for what it says it intends to be only a temporary
          loss of 
          performance for blind users, and writing as though they are
          going to 
          permanently use a different browser without even seeing the
          results of the 
          work being done is disturbing.  At the moment, Chrome may be
          better than 
          Firefoxs in its latest version because of the changes.  But
          blind people may 
          be better served by what Mozilla is doing after the initial
          inconvenience.

            How often do sighted people complain about things like road
          construction 
          and repair, but would they never use the road again because of
          the temporary 
          inconvenience?  They may use a different road during the
          repairs and the 
          road may even be closed at times, but they return to it when
          it is in good 
          order again.

            Well the beta I tried simply refused to say anything but
          unknown on any
            page, though most of the menus still worked.

            I'm not inclined to update since I use the sound,
          particularly the one 
          when
            a page has fully loaded and the one that tells me a link has
          in fact
            activated and of course download complete


            I have seen elsewhere where people think these sounds are
          pointless. I
            dispute this as everyone is different and I really only use
          browsers where 
          I
            can actually hear that things are going on. for example I've
          always 
          noticed
            that screenreaders sometimes do not figure out the page has
          loaded, but
            navigational sounds does and hence allows me to re focus the
          screenreader.
             Also I would not know if a download had completed if the
          download pane 
          was
            hidden without a sound.
             Some links click but clickables do not so sometimes you can
          figure out 
          what
            is which sort of link on a page this way. In a way it would
          be even better
            if button link and clickable had different sounds to save
          one getting
            confused.

            I think the list of things some of us want in a browser is
          obviously going
            to be different to what the sighted want, so one will really
          need somebody
            at Mozilla etc to write blind specific add ons for a
          browser.
             Its far easier when trying to teach somebody how to use a
          browser to be
            able to say, if you do not hear x then its not worked.

I tried to put the I pad I share with my friend when I was on vacation. It would not let me. I had an old recovery email address that no longer exists. So I had to delete it and add the email address that we share on the iphone. Google acted like someone was trying to get into my account. So I had to have my room mate go on IE or whatever apple uses as a web browser. She had to allow access to it then it said that my gmail is less secure witch is not true. That is bizarre where you try to sign in and it wants you to create an account when you already have one.

are evidently being signed in by your e-mail program using the same 
information.  What settings are you using for cookies?  If you don't 
allow cookies, I'm not sure how Google reacts to that.  Do you also have 
more than one browser on your machine?  If it is a browser problem and you

Is this what happens?  You go to the site and 
the page comes up where you enter your GMail address.  Then when you 
activate the next button, you are taken to the create an account page.  

 
If that is what is happening do the following just 
as I describe and see what happens:
In forms mode, type your e-mail 
address.
Tab once.  If you go out of forms mode, go 
back in.  Read the current line to make sure you are still on the next 
button.  Press the space bar if you are.  Don't press enter.

to be activated, not the next button.

problem.  It is not the problem of sites and I've often heard it when 
working with web sites.  
 
As far as sites being too 
clever, I have no idea what is being referred to.  Sometimes, for reasons I 
don't know, where you are in browse mode may not correspond to where you are in 
forms mode.  That is why I said to stay in forms mode and try to move to 
and enter information in the correct field.  The assumption that these are 
problems caused by sites has no evidence or foundation.  If experimentation 
or looking at source code can demonstrate that a site's coding is causing 
problems, then that might be different.  If these are normal variants and 
NVDA doesn't react properly, then that is an NVDA problem.  Making 
assumptions of this sort may make learning to work with such problems less 
likely as the invalid assumption may encourage not experimenting as much.

I have flagged the coding of the ""no"" button inhis drop-down list. That is the only one which is not coded as ""no"" in theoption list but does appear as ""No"" in the displayed result when you choosethe third option. This implies that the code he is using to populate thedrop down list is at fault. The actual selection displays correctly for thatoption. There are no other faults with the coding of the questionnaire.In fact, I have tried other questionnaires generated on this site onprevious occasions and they gave me great problems where you could not tellif the option displayed in the question referred to the question thatpreceded it or which followed it. He has nothing like that here.!The wholequestionnaire is solid. Another chronic problem with other questionnaires isthe editor program that provided to allow you to enter free form data. Inother questionnaires I have not been able to keep the cursor in track withthe reading cursor. On other occasions, spaces appear when there should be acharacter that I have typed . The programmer has none of this here. Hiseditor is accurately in track with the review cursor, however he has managedto do it! I wish you would give Gene a full answer to his questions. It is rare thatwe encounter a good accessible production like this questionnaire. You mayfind that you have been burdened with the rare option that confounds theprogrammer's efforts.

NVDA key s and Control NVDA key v are used without going into the menus?  
You can get to the same settings in the menus but such commands are shortcuts 
that bypass the menus.  You can use them anywhere.  You aren't in NVDA 
when you use them.  You could be on the desktop, in a program, almost 
anywhere.  
 
In the menus, you would get to such settings by 
opening the menus, then down arrowing to preferences and pressing enter.  
Then down arrow to either synthesizer and press enter or voice settings and 
press enter.  It sounds as though you would save yourself a lot of time and 
trouble by working with a good NVDA tutorial such as the one I sent a link to a 
number of days ago.

20024,Gene,2017-06-13 13:11:26.645706015,"Also, the default for NVDA is to save settings on 
exit.  If you are going to experiment, this is a bad setting.  It 
means that you might save settings you have no intention of making 
permanent.  This setting should be disabled.  Open the NVDA menu, down 
arrow to preferences and press enter.  You are in a dialog.  Tab to 
save settings on exit.  It's a check box.  Uncheck it by pressing the 
space bar.  Tab to and activate the ok button.
Now save the setting to make it permanent.  
Issue the command control NVDA key c and you should hear configuration 
saved.  I never have NVDA save anything automatically.  I want to 
control exactly when things are saved.  In my strong opinion, save settings 
on exit should not be enabled by default.  It does a real disservice to new 
users who may want to try different settings with no intention of making them 
permanent.  A perfect example of too much automation.  
 
Do you know how to find information in the 
manual? It's one long web page.  Here is what the manual says in it's 
first sentence or two about input composition settings:
The Input Composition Settings dialog can be found 
under the Preferences menu. This dialog allows you to control how NVDA reports 
the input of Asian characters, such as with IME or Text Service 
 
 
Clearly, something you might be curious to know 
what it is, but nothing it would make any sense to play with other than look at 
unless you use Asian characters.

20096,Chris Mullins,2017-06-14 11:09:32.311467777,"Hi AnthonyIt does not matter if the command is written Control NVDA s or NVDA Control s because it is exactly the same command.  You should be pressing and holding down the NVDA and control keys and whilst doing so, press the s key.  You may also see the command written as NVDA+Control+s, which better illustrates the command is a combination of the 3 keys.  Because the NVDA and Control keys are modifier keys, you can hold them down then press s rather than trying to press all 3 simultaneously.  Modifier keys send additional information from the keyboard to the computer when combined with a standard key, in this case the letter s.  NVDA is running on the computer, identifies that the keypress code you have typed contains the NVDA modifier key code so knows it needs to be processed by the NVDA program As for the punctuation that is spoken, it depends on how you are reading the tutorial.  If you are arrowing character by character, it will read all punctuation.  If you open the NVDA voice dialog by pressing NVDA+Control+v, tab to the Punctuation symbol level combo box, set it to none and press enter.  This will eliminate the voicing of punctuation when reading line by line using the down arrow and using the ‘Say All’ command (NVDA+Down Arrow).

When you press the enter key on the link it will take you up to the dropbox account. You might have to change modes from focus mode to browse mode. Go down the page you will hear the file name and there is a download button to get it. I think it was near

Then it is a matter of saving it to your pc. It then play correctly for me in winamp etc.

50644,Shaun Everiss,2018-11-18 19:19:26.813310759,"Well to be honest, I know while I generally try to spell right enough to save my rear and can do so, I get over confident at times with my typing speed and so things can get messed up and most of the time I catch it.Now speech wize, because we use speech technology we heavily rely on it.Thats good but since no synth can know every language or word and pronounciations can slightly differ from word to word the synth and its data are not always correct worse, depending on the program you use the spelling is not correct.While a few programs quite a lot of those in fact use country spaciffic languages most don't especially if they are unicode or old.The default national languages are us and uk and while thats fine as a basis for language itself english wize, there are differences to spelling.Its why I turn auto correct spell and gramma off where I can.In fact in chrome, when filling out an email address, at some point, I will get a message that I have spelt something wrong because it thinks I am writing a sentence.And while in office and some other programs like windows its gotten a lot better of late, there was a time not to long ago when I was in school at least back in 1998 where I was always failing because I spelt things wrongly.I had relied on my computer spellchecker to fix words I didn't know and to check spelling but it was in us and always was in us language unless you manually changed it.This trend went on as far as office 2010, with some change in 2013, in office 2016 you can change languages but things usually work.Then there is a way a word is pronounced, it can be spelt wrong but sound fine or it can be spelt fine and sound wrong.Next speech synths in general are not good with language switching, try to type a word in german on any synth that is more than a couple years old and maybe some of them still exist try to type a word in maori, german or anything other than your native language and if its not switched to that dictionary its not going to get it right neither will your spell checker.Now with the way the cloud and the multi language thing works we seem to be able to get things on the fly a lot better.Even if you have the automatic switches off if it finds something in another language it will usually try to speak it right, of course the voice could be an issue if you don't understand or have never heard that word before but my point is at least it tries.One thing that I have found a slight disapointment is the availability of all languages in synths, espeak has come close to include a lot more varients than most.However in my old realspeak, even though I am on uk some us vouls and pronouncements make it in  even in australian and I suspect that not everything got translated right and this is a high quality voice we are talking about now.Even with all this set, there are no dialect synths for some countries, new zealand for example hasn't got one, maori hasn't got one, I don't give a damn about the maori language but if principal is to be believed then we really need synths that handle every language and we still don't.So if I type a maori placename in a document, its never going to come out right because no language for it.We use australian language because its the closest to us for the most part and its fine even then that uses the uk language set.Point is we blind people are not bad spellers, our stuff is, as we get more data it will get better and with the cloud thats only going to improve but its never going to be perfect.Eventually maybe once we get enough of them we can use braille to but maybe by then we will be able to no longer be blind anymore even so, it would be nice to get everything like my reader speaking in my own language just because is all.And its not just the blind we rely a lot on spell checkers, automatic updaters, security programs, and a lot of things with their own rulesets.If it goes we freak out big time, but your technology or whatever tool is only as good as its data set and thats a fact.Its not crap if it screws up, sadly, not many people keep the datasets as updated as we should.We spend time trying to stop x program stuffing up a lot more than trying to make sure the data works, even if it all worked we would still have issues.People talk about the ai take over apocolipse thing.It won't be the robots messing up, we will probably mess up first because of a glitch we  from something we rely on and freak.Look at the news for example, facebook went down yesterday and its now the end of the world.Take the net down and the world will end all right.",wonder vs. wander,33,50643

      the slower reading time.

Any time you hear a speech synthesizer saying something ""exaggeratedly"" that should be a big, honkin' warning that something's off.Kudos, though, on this post.  It was extremely clever.  I do, however, believe that one should be able to hear the difference, even in synthesized speech in the middle of a sentence, between pro deuce and produce (as but one example).  There's also the question of whether we're talking produce as a verb or noun, as the stress is on the second syllable in the first instance and the first syllable in the second.  That being said, the speed at which many blind individuals can understand voice output from screen readers just astounds me.  I could no sooner wrap my head around speech that fast than fly to the moon using my own arms as propulsion.  If you have speech produced at ear blistering (for me) speeds then the elisions between two short words and a single word with the same phonemes becomes much harder to suss out. --

Spanish.  it sounds as though the x is silent.  It doesn't matter what 
language you speak.  If you intend to write a word in a formal situation, 
you should check unfamiliar words to make sure you know how to spell them.  
Even in informal situations, checking spelling of names is important.  

 
You should check any but obvious names.  You 
don't have to check Bill, for example.  You do have to check Gene.  Is 
it Gene, g e n e, or Jean j e a n.  Is it  Tony Tony ending in y for a 
man, or toni ending in I which is used for both men's and women's names and 
which can be a short form for some women's names.  Don't assume except in 
obvious cases.  and even something that seems obvious may not be.  If 
you don't know that the name Brian has two spellings, one B R Y A N, the other B 
R I A N, do you want to embarrass yourself by assuming there is only one?

names, Bill, John, Alice, Jane, etc.

50735,Gene,2018-11-19 20:09:43.799039872,"I think one reason people spell it as capture is 
because many English accents or dialects don't pronounce r's at the end of 
words.  So captcha and capture sound identical or very similar.  

 

Sighted people who know how to spell or who see daily, 
that all sorts of names or acronyms are not spelled as they sound, don't do 
so.  Blind people should be rigorously taught, as a part of learning to use 
computer technology to check spelling when using names and acronyms except when 
there is no doubt and no possibility of ambiguity, when using speech.  No 
one has thought to make this a standard part of training materials.  It is 
so important that, even if the rest of the tutorial or manual has nothing to do 
with such topics, there should be a section emphasizing that at the start of all 
such material.  I wish I had realized that when I created my Internet 
tutorial years ago.",wonder vs. wander,33,50732

check it.  If it does, then the person isn't using the technology 
efficiently.  It is important for Braille users not to diminish what can 
and should be done with speech.  That is implying a superiority of Braille 
which is true for some uses, not true for others.  
 
Note that I didn't say Braille is inferior for any 
uses, I'm saying that the assumption that speech users must be at a disadvantage

assumption.
