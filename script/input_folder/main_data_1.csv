You don't need to manually delete folders or anything like that. The goal of reinstallation is to get it to re-add the dll files that handle speech in the hopes that'll straighten it out. Another possible explanation would be that it thinks you have other screen readers running too, although in that case it probably would still default to JAWS as highest priority.

I use Windows 7 here, and updating NVDA has never caused any extra problems for me, so any Windows 7 user can still safely install NVDA updates, given that many of the changes benefit all of us, not just Windows 10 users.Bye for now!From Clare",2016.2.1,30

5411,Gene,2016-06-13 14:15:03.267812291,"I've almost never done an NVDA Upgrade using the 
automatic upgrader.  The reawson is that it is an example of what I 
consider excessive automation.  If I'm wrong, I hope to be corrected but as 
I understand it the update installs over the current version and doesn't keep 
the current version's installation file.  That makes going back far too 
inconvenient if someone wants to.  I strongly believe that the updater 
should ask where you want the current exe file if you want to revert.  You 
should be able to update and still be able to go back easily.  That ability 
might make people far more willing to upgrade.
 
There may be different ways the NVDA designers want 
to have the upgrade work but I strongly believe that until such a system is 
introduced, that people keep a copy of their current installer so they can 
revert without worrying about where to find it.

I’ve been lucky not to have had to downgrade NVDA, but I still like to have the old installers available on my computer in case I ever need them. That’s just the way I do thins, it’s up to others how they choose to update their NVDA.Bye for now!From Clare",2016.2.1,30

to offer to save it.

relevant.  People should be easily able to revert if the upgrade has a 
problem.  Also, in the case of JAWS, you can have as many copies on your 
machine as you want.  In other words, you can have as many previous 
versions as you wish.  I don't think you can if you upgrade automatically 
but if that's correct, then that's a good reason not to use the automatic 
upgrader.  It has long been standard advice that if you do a full version 
upgrade of JAWS, that you keep the old version on your machine until you have 
used the new one enough to evaluate it.

Gene, I agree. Even if I do the automatic update, I 
always make sure to also go get the latest installation file as well, and will 
keep at least the two most recent ones until I know I'm quite happy with the

None of the buttons or the additional instructions are accessible here on windows 7. I'd be obliged if somebody who knows the inner workings of NVDA can look at this issue. Its probably more important that it can be fixed for preferences and the share dialogue though as it seems pressing enter on the delete alert will in fact  result in a global deletion. Sadly none of the buttons are highlighted  at all by any keyboard action I can come up with, indeed these buttons are not there according to nvdA/b.My guess is that they are either native windows 10 specific controls that should not be used in software like windows 7, or they are in fact not accessible to anybody.Dropbox, being the main platform used by many people I think has a responsibility to be accessible in this domain.Their web sites menu system keeps on turning on focus mode and having to have it turned off the get at the menus then when you select it goes into focus mode again. its obviously non standard so we need a real working desktop interface here.Brianbglists@...Sent via blueyonder.Please address personal E-mail to:-briang1@..., putting 'Brian Gaff'in the display name field.",Dropbox innaccessibility again,30

this problem, or perhaps one more person has, that is quite suggestive evidence 
that the problem may be yours or not at all common.
 
It may be caused by running something else or 
taking an action such as uninstalling something that is uncommon or very 
uncommon.  I don't consider the fact that it happens on two different 
machines to make this much less likely.  Since both machines are owned and

taken on both machines.

I have office both at home and at work, and I rely on a spell checker to make sure I don’t send out misspelled words.
I recall the JawsLite list used to offer a spell checker utility that when installed, gave a spell checker for eMail clients.
I’m not sure if captcha is in the dictionary, but for other instances, it is a must.
I think that most Blind folks who lost their sight early on are bad spellers, since we listen to material more than we read it in Braille.
I know that my spelling is not as good as it was when I could read print.
But it is important for us to send messages without misspelled words.

E-mail programs generally have their own spell checkers.  Outlook Express

checker that can be used but I don’t know how good it is.
 
If you are using a browser to 
send a message, incorrectly spelled words are flagged but I am not aware of 
suggestions, just the flag.  At times, I use a word processor with a spell 
checker to write and spell check something and then paste it into the web site's 
editor.
 
I don't know if there are 
formatting proboems doing this and I often correct spelling errors manually in

From what I go t told the copy of office 2010 was installed not taken off.


I as you have heard that sometimes a older version of office will do this i guess more maybe if unsupported. I could see if when it was installed it caused it but it should not as I have the same version here.

31292,Gene New Zealand,2017-12-07 04:27:11.896914264,"Hi


Do you mean by keyboard navigation the usual?


Like using the arrow keys tab etc etc.


You would find it quite easy to pick up.


Depending if you install nvda to your pc you will have the choice of the desktop layout or a lap top layout for your keyboard.


If you install nvda to your pc it is the alt key + ctrl key + letter N to start nvda.
To get into your preferences is the nvda key + the letter N
To quit your copy of nvda is the nvda key + the letter Q


Where i refer to the nvda key this is a modifier key and can be the insert key the extended insert key or the caps lock key. You would use one of the with a key to turn off nvda. for example if the insert key is chosen you would use the insert key + letter
 Q to turn off nvda.


NVDA comes default with the e speak synth but you can use other free or paid synths.


The synth you are talking about is a commercial one and can come as a add on or a sapi 5 version  at a cost.


There are keys combo that are simular to jaws and plus you can change them if needed.

So if there are 10 objects side to side you will hear them all being red. If you want to go to the eighth object you hold NVDA and CTRL and press right arrow key to navigate there. However, screen review does not recognize the distance between objects reliably. So there could be two objects which are being red as if they were a single word. In this case you have to navigat letter by letter with NVDA + right arrow. You activate an object by pressing enter. In contrast, object navigation uses the hierarchie of objects on the screen but it does not give you an exact map of the screen. Apart from that, object navigation is not restricted on the active window. The advantage of object navigation is that the names of objects are being recognized very reliable in comparison to screen review. And object navigation gives you much more information than screen review. You can learn how menus are grouped and how an application is structured without loosing your cursor position. Go for example in firefox quantum settings and try to read the group of settings by using object navigation.On each group you have to press down arrow to enter it and up arrow to leave it. Once you are in a group, press right and left arrow to move through the entries of the group. To move the mouse to a group, press m.

Gene,


 


You bring up something which poses a question
              I've had for a while now.


 


Is there really any advantage to using screen
              review over object nav, or vice versa?

There is no setting to use the equivalent
                of the JAWS cursor with standard movement keys such as
                up and down arrow.  There is an equivalent to the JAWS
                cursor, screen review and you navigate mostly using the
                numpad in that mode.  It's somewhat similar to
                Window-eyes in that you can still use the arrow keys on
                the main keyboard and the main navigation commands for
                screen review are on the numpad.  This is for the
                desktop layout.  I don't know what the navigation
                commands are for the laptop layout.  


 


After using screen review, you should
                return to object navigation.  If you do, certain review
                commands you may want to use won't work correctly. For
                example I don't like using the read current line command
                NVDA uses.  I use numpad 8 which reads the current
                object, which acts the same as read current line.

I started using NVDA recently, and I really
              was surprised at how similar the default keyboard layout
              is to that of JAWS. I’m sure this wasn’t done by accident.
              The only thing is, that navigation and focus does work a
              little differently. And of ourse, ther’es no “JAWS
              cursor”, but that particular JFW feature is growing less
              and less useful as times goes on (though I still use it a
              fair bit in certain older applications that don’t have
              screen-reader support built in or any add-ons). 
 
NVDA’s web support is great, and while I
              happen to only have Office 2010 on this Windows 10
              machine, Outlook and Word both function pretty much as
              well as they do with JFW. Others have reported issues with
              office 2016/365, but, well, this isn’t unique to nVDA
              users so far as I can tell.

Yes the reading navigation keys.

              I've been using JAWS for 20+ years. It's like my fingers
              have a mind of their own. Will be very difficult to change
              my habits from wanting to use the numpad keys for
              navigation.

              Will definitely take some time.

Hi


              Do you mean by keyboard navigation the usual?


              Like using the arrow keys tab etc etc.


              You would find it quite easy to pick up.


              Depending if you install nvda to your pc you will have the
              choice of the desktop layout or a lap top layout for your
              keyboard.


              If you install nvda to your pc it is the alt key + ctrl
              key + letter N to start nvda.

              To get into your preferences is the nvda key + the letter
              N

              To quit your copy of nvda is the nvda key + the letter Q


              Where i refer to the nvda key this is a modifier key and
              can be the insert key the extended insert key or the caps
              lock key. You would use one of the with a key to turn off
              nvda. for example if the insert key is chosen you would
              use the insert key + letter Q to turn off nvda.


              NVDA comes default with the e speak synth but you can use
              other free or paid synths.


              The synth you are talking about is a commercial one and
              can come as a add on or a sapi 5 version  at a cost.


              There are keys combo that are simular to jaws and plus you
              can change them if needed.

Hello,

              Well the time has come that I can no longer afford to pay
              the Freedom Scientific SMA JAWS upgrades (Been using JAWS
              for over 20 years), so I'm turning to NVDA. 

              My first two questions: 

              Does NVDA use a keyboard navigation system similar to
              JAWS? If not, is there a way I can configure it to work
              this way? 

              Also can I configure NVDA to use the Eloquence module
              currently installed on my PC (Thanks to JAWS?) If not, is
              there a NVDA software synth available that's just as good
              to use? 

              Thanks for any help.

Subject: [nvda] NVDA and CCleaner (free, anyway)




      Hello All,

      I was just trying out NVDA with the latest version of CCleaner
      free and seem to have encountered an accessibility issue that may
      be the result of operator error.

      The ""large buttons"" that control which major function you're under
      can be reached by tabbing or up/down arrowing, and if you hit
      spacebar on any one of them its control buttons come up.  What is
      odd is that you still end up either tabbing or arrowing past the
      other major control buttons before you hit the ""function control
      buttons"" for the major function you've activated.

      I do have problems reaching the individual checkboxes under the
      Options (major), Monitoring (minor) function.  It's odd because
      when I activate the Monitoring button, and if I have the NVDA
      Focus Highlight add-on running, there is clearly a quick scan down
      the list of controls, which are mostly checkboxes, but you cannot
      seem to come to rest on any of them to access them.

      Is there a way to get oneself over into the ""checkbox area"" (for
      lack of a better term) of this function in order to be able to
      deal with the checkboxes.  Since mouse tracking is on by default I
      know that these exist as far as NVDA is concerned as when I hover
      over them I get appropriate feedback, I just can't seem to reach
      them via the keyboard, which would be essential.

I don't see that it should hurt.  Most of the updates to CCleaner are not, to my knowledge, security related.   Over time certain additional bells and whistles, like active monitoring, have been added.I would hope that CCleaner and screen readers would eventually ""mesh"" again, as it's a PITA to obtain earlier versions if you don't already have them archived. --

Here is what I encounter in the last two versions of Ccleaner. 



After I click on the Run cleaner button, and after the cleaning
      action is completed, when I tab and/or shift-tab, I get stuck in
      the mud while tabbing through the interface. When I get stuck in
      the mud, without being able to do anything by means of the
      keyboard, I can hear the first two words I can remember which NVDA
      says. These are: Var strings. 



When I get stuck in the mud area of the interface, it is
      impossible to do anything as far as the keyboard is concerned.

      be able to tell us what steps to take next.

Subject: [nvda] NVDA and CCleaner (free, anyway)




      Hello All,

      I was just trying out NVDA with the latest version of CCleaner
      free and seem to have encountered an accessibility issue that may
      be the result of operator error.

      The ""large buttons"" that control which major function you're under
      can be reached by tabbing or up/down arrowing, and if you hit
      spacebar on any one of them its control buttons come up.  What is
      odd is that you still end up either tabbing or arrowing past the
      other major control buttons before you hit the ""function control
      buttons"" for the major function you've activated.

      I do have problems reaching the individual checkboxes under the
      Options (major), Monitoring (minor) function.  It's odd because
      when I activate the Monitoring button, and if I have the NVDA
      Focus Highlight add-on running, there is clearly a quick scan down
      the list of controls, which are mostly checkboxes, but you cannot
      seem to come to rest on any of them to access them.

      Is there a way to get oneself over into the ""checkbox area"" (for
      lack of a better term) of this function in order to be able to
      deal with the checkboxes.  Since mouse tracking is on by default I
      know that these exist as far as NVDA is concerned as when I hover
      over them I get appropriate feedback, I just can't seem to reach
      them via the keyboard, which would be essential.

However, I have a number of documents that I must read for a board meeting next Wednesday. Some of these are in word form having been created in Word 2010. I could read them fine in Word 2016 until I came to a set of tables that are made up of four columns and 13 rows. The NVDA reading commands did not work at all in the tables. I then saved them to a text file with a view to seeing if the tables are tab delimited but I cannot see that in Notepad. So, will have to use Notepad++ to check that out. I then highlighted the entire word document and copied it to the clipboard for pasting into a new Excel worksheet. This time the text was all confined to column A but the tables were set out perfectly. Excel allows one to move from cell to cell using the arrow keys.  Finally, I asked the author of the original word 2010 document save the file as a .pdf file. This was the most readable form. The NVDA table reading commands worked fine for moving from cell to cell. The only problem there was that the column headings command was not available. I could not then set NVDA to call out the column or row headings as   I traversed the tables in the .pdf file. Another major complication occurred with the fact that all the files were in protected view due to their having arrived as attachments. I made the mistake of opening one of the Word files without turning off the protected mode setting in the properties of the file. This caused Word to go berserk! NVDA froze, Windows froze and I had to force a reboot! Then the PC took ages to come back up and even longer to let me through the initial logon screen. I have much to learn! All the best, Cearbhall m +353 (0)833323487 Ph: _353 (0)1-2864623 e: cearbhall.omeadhra@...",NVDA and office 2016,30
6572,Cearbhall O'Meadhra,2016-07-21 21:26:47.233990690,"Further to my earlier message, I have tried this in both browse mode and Focus mode in NVDA with no luck.  It seems that the table in question was generated from a standard template issued by a government department and inserted into the current document. The document author then had to fill in the relevant variable data into the template. To do so, he had to make a left mouse click on the cell in order to open  it in edit mode. This author is sighted by the way. I think it relevant to mention his access method and source of the table since it turned out to be somewhat inaccessible. I have found NVDA well able to read other tables in Word 2016 files as I studied more documents later today. The Word problem seems to have been a particular issue relating to a custom made template that did not appear to conform to default Word methods of construction.  I am still puzzled by Excel 2016! When I highlight an excel workbook in my documents and press enter on it, I expect it to open in excel and display its contents. However, in Excel 2016, when I press enter on the file after unblocking it, Excel opens and NVDA can see nothing. A “Say all” command revealed a page of choices of different worksheet types that could be launched but no sign of my worksheet. There was one option which invited me to open  without specifying a particular type of worksheet. I press that but still nothing appeared. On going to the File ribbon, I discovered the name of my would-be worksheet listed in the “Recents” list. When I pressed that item in the Recents list, the worksheet opened! I was then able to read it. I cannot see any way to open the worksheet from a file list as I used to with excel 2010.

6573,Quentin Christensen,2016-07-21 23:20:55.622547335,"Hi Cearbhall,Re the strange Word template, if the document isn't too sensitive and you can send it to me privately I'd be happy to have a look - it might be something we can work on addressing.As you've found with other files, NVDA's table commands SHOULD work on tables in Word.  As an intermediate workaround, possibly converting the document to HTML would enable it to be read as a web page.  If you go to File, Save As and from the filename field, press TAB to move to the ""save as type"" drop down and choose ""Web page (*.htm, *.html)"".The HTML Word creates is ugly and bloated, but for reading it on a local machine, it might work.When you open files from e-mail or the web, by default Word will open them in ""reading view"" which is possible to read but works very differently  (I wrote a section on it in the Word training material we'll be releasing in the next couple of months).  What I would recommend, is if you go into the Word options (alt+f then t), on that first, general page, tab to an option called ""Open e-mail attachments and other uneditable files in reading view"", and uncheck that - If you open a file from an email attachment etc then, it will open in the regular print layout so you can navigate as normal.  It will still be protected, so you'll need to press F6 to go to the ""Protected view grouping"" and press the ""enable editing"" button if you trust the sender and want to enable editing.When you open any of the Office 2016 programs, instead of opening to a blank document / spreadsheet etc, it opens to the start screen.  You can either press ENTER to open a blank document, or you can navigate around to recent files or templates.  If you want to go back to the old style of opening directly to a blank file, go into the settings again and on that general page, the option after the one about opening email attachments is ""show the start screen when this application starts"" which you'll want to uncheck.These options only apply to the current program so you'll need to uncheck it in Excel and any other Office programs you use too.Re opening recent documents from the file list - Do you mean when you press alt+f you can press up arrow and find them listed at the bottom near exit?  You actually can do that:  Back in the options, this time control+tab down to ""advanced"", then tab a heap of times, or press alt+q to jump straight to ""Quickly access this number of recent documents"".  Once you check that option, you can tab to the next edit field which has a number (4 by default) and set that to whatever you like.What that does, is visually, it puts the recent files at the bottom of the file menu, although if you press up arrow or shift+tab it actually starts moving around the file info tab, so instead you need to press either a number (1 for the most recent, 2 for the next most recent etc), or down arrow to the list.  Interestingly once you start down arrowing and get to the ""new"" tab, you could then up arrow twice to get to the last recent file in the list, but I haven't found a more direct way (if anyone does, please let me know!).Note: most of this will be in the ""Microsoft Word with NVDA"" material, available in the next couple of months.  It is designed as a follow up to the ""Basic Training for NVDA"" module which is available now: http://www.nvaccess.org/shop/Kind regardsQuentin.",NVDA and office 2016,30

performance differences whether it is on or off.  It doesn't do anything 
unless you move into it and do somethink like move to a different folder.  
It is nothing but a treeview of folders that is loaded when the program is run 
and it just sits there if not used.  I suppose it may take an extremely 
small time, probably almost immeasurable, when you first run the program for the 
treeview to populate but it should not even be noticeable unless you compared 
program loading times using some sort of timing device..
 
Have you compared or are you assuming that it slows 
down performance in some way?  And then, there is the ques5tion of where 
the control y dialog gets its information when run.  It actually may be 
slower to open that dialog and have it populate every time you want to switch 
folders instead of having a treeview load once and remain.

Without knowing what the user wants (such as exact settings he or she wishes to change) and level of familiarity with NVDA, we won’t be able to guide the user to places where he or she can change appropriate settings.

In the past, I have used ZoomText, mainly for magnification but did use the Reader some. I have not purchased the ZoomText version that is compatible with Win10. Because my eyes can tire easily, especially when looking at the screen too long, thus I thought I'd try a screen reader.

format.  You can listen to the text, listen to the audio, or skim or search 
the text to find something and then, listen to the audio.  The two are 
synchronized.  There is no additional benefit in listening to the mp3 files 
in the Daisy book as stand alone files in an mp3 player.  You already can 
get the tutorial in that form..  
 
I should also say that I have hardly used Daisy 
material.  Perhaps there is just Daisy material that is almost all just 
recorded audio.  If so, I would think there would be some sort of text you 
can look at that indicates the beginning of sections and perhaps gives names of 
the different sections so you can search for the section you want, then start

This is possibly why people are not managing to read it as a Daisy Book. For example when I tried to open the daisy package.odf in FS  Reader it reported that the file was unreadable . When I try to open it from the context menu in Explorer and  point to FS Reader it caused it to crash. As an experiment I tried to also open it in calibre to see the actual file contexnts and calibre also reported it as unreadable.However I did manage to open it in Notepad.However  no daisy reader I have   can interpret it as a book.David Griffith My Blind Access and Guide dog Bloghttp://dgriffithblog.wordpress.com/My Blind hammer Bloghttps://www.westhamtillidie.com/authors/blind-hammer/posts,Now available: DAISY version of Welcome to NVDA 2018,30

You can copy it to HumanWare's victor Reader 
players and depending on the structure you can navigate by different levels, 
e.g. headings, chapter, page, etc.  I have just downloaded the zipped 
archive and copied it to my victor Reader Stream 2.  There are three levels 
of navigation, chapter, heading and phrase, and whatever time jump you have 
selected.  .  There is only audio playback, there isn't associated 
text.  Before each chapter, there is the NVDA installation 
music.
 
Many thanks to Joseph for all his hard work 
recording the tutorial.

If you have an NLS player, you should be able to use it for Daisy
      books.  Of course you won't get a text accompaniment, but it will
      play them and if properly constructed, you can move by chapters,
      sections ETC.

Pure audio DAISY allows
            you, provided it’s been properly structured, to jump to the
            start of chapters, sections, paragraphs etc; however, you do
            need a DAISY-compatible player such as the Victor Reader
            Stream or Plextalk or DAISY software to take advantage of
            this.

You need an mp3 player unless you
              can look and play the files separately.  I haven't looked
              at the layout of Daisy books enough to know.  the whole
              point of the daisy format is to be able to see material as
              you listen.  JAWS has training material in the daisy
              format.  You can listen to the text, listen to the audio,
              or skim or search the text to find something and then,
              listen to the audio.  The two are synchronized.  There is
              no additional benefit in listening to the mp3 files in the
              Daisy book as stand alone files in an mp3 player.  You
              already can get the tutorial in that form..  


 


I should also say that I have
              hardly used Daisy material.  Perhaps there is just Daisy
              material that is almost all just recorded audio.  If so, I
              would think there would be some sort of text you can look
              at that indicates the beginning of sections and perhaps
              gives names of the different sections so you can search
              for the section you want, then start listening to the
              audio at that point.

The audio recordings are in mp3 format,

There is an additional, importantcondition to be met: the community must demand it. I want to see thecommunity wanting this; I want to see the community REALLY wanting this tohappen; I want to see the community rise up to do it; I want to get a firmpromise from the community that they'll take care of this with highest ofstandards. Yes, I'm setting the bar really high on this for a number ofreasons:1. Initiated and driven by the community: the era where you can just rely onone person to do all sorts of things is coming to a close. In fact, weshould have left that era a long time ago. I believe that one way to moveforward is to let the community take care of itself when it is time to do so(after being nurtured by leaders), hence my condition above regarding texttranscripts. I do know that the community can go above and beyond what I didand can produce higher quality tutorials (complete with text transcripts),hence the high quality requirement; but it won't work if the communitydoesn't rise up to do this and other huge projects on its own.2. Passing the torch to the next group of leaders: as noted a few weeks ago,my active time with the community is slowly coming to a close. I believethis is a great opportunity to find and teach the next group of leaders, andone way to do so is giving them something to practice their skills, andleading a huge project from start to finish is a good exercise. This is oneof the reasons why I don't involve myself a lot with NVDACon planningrecently, because I do know that current organizers can do a much better jobat organizing this gathering. Same could be set about transcriptions:although some guidance is needed in the beginning, I believe that thecommunity is more than ready to tackle this from start to finish: producinga high quality text transcription of the tutorial set.3. Personal: I carry out some important community duties on top of being astudent and a speech and debate competitor (with trophies under my belt,including several first place finishes and being qualified to go to nationaltournaments). If you thought I am just an NVDA Expert because I can answerquestions with detailed guesses at midnight or seem to possess encyclopedicknowledge about NVDA source code, I'd like you to sincerely think again,taking into consideration who I really am: a student volunteer. Given thatacademics takes highest of highest of priorities, I dare not go throughanother project that'll drain me (this is the biggest regret I have aboutproducing the audio tutorial set when I should have been taking breaks).To be blunt (sorry for coming across as too harsh): I usually don't say thisin public, but I believe it must be said before it is too late: anaccomplishment without a spark and a flame is nothing. That is, if you justwish for things to happen without acting on it, it would have been better tonot wish it in the first place. One of the reasons why I felt burnt out fromthis community (especially during tutorial set production) is people'stendency to ask without acting on that wish, and a persistent attitude thatone must wait for a savior to give guidance without taking the initiative tothink progress and search for things on one's own. And I'm afraid thateither I have contributed to this problem, or that we are not heeding thisand similar criticisms. Thus, before we go any further (such as downloadingthe book format one cannot read right now), I sincerely advise you to heedthis criticism for once, because without doing so, we won't see muchprogress; I think it would be helpful for us (as a community) to assess whatwe're doing, our attitudes, and what we need to do in the future, so that wecan be a much better community: a community where people can answer eachother with more confidence.Hope this helps. I do know that my post may come across as harsh, and maynot have answered your questions. But I believe that there are moreimportant matters to think about, more important than text transcription ofWelcome to NVDA 2018 that'll have profound effect on this community andbeyond.Cheers,Joseph",Now available: DAISY version of Welcome to NVDA 2018,30

As NVDA largely supports those of us whoare blind or visually impaired, The your audio version makes the Tutorial inMP3 available to the widest user profile. I can't imagine the time you putinto the production. I hope that others know that you didn't just sit downand start recording off the top of your head. The material is far too wellorganized and your examples to well selected and described to not have takenyou untold hours of pre-production. A text version would allow one to cut and paste a personal set of reminders,but in no way, should that fall on you. I can also understand that you wouldnot be comfortable with less than an exact accurate copy of your work.Though you did not copyright the Tutorial, which you might have elected todo. Nor did you offer to sell it, though I, for one, would have gladly paid.I suggest to this group that volunteers could use this forum to create afree transcription Service, divide up the tutorial with each person takingon sections to produce in a common text format.

Interesting that such a file showed up as text readable by Voiceover on an iPad: I can't explain that!However, as regards a solution to the problem of such blank-looking .pdf files on Windows, I use Omnipage, the OCR program I have here, to make the text in such files accessible, even though this usually means having two copies of the file, because the text version is in another format, usually Word in my case.I'm not familiar with other OCR programs on Windows, but I would guess that at least some of them have a similar function, where image files in .pdf containing text can be converted to formats like .rtf or .doc which are more accessible.I hope this helps!Bye for now!From Clare",Problem with reading pdf,30

I've had occasions where the whole document has had 1 character on each line, or all words running together with no spaces By far the biggest issue is people producing newspaper like pdfs, but never locally tagging the reading order when the number of columns changes. The second most common cock up is the screen of text which is merely a picture of text. To the sighted, this seems ok in the most part, but I'm told often the clarity of the letters is so bad that not even trying to OCR it will come up with a valid readable result. Sadly a lot of manufacturers manuals fall into this category. If its really good you can use the nvda Add on ocr for the task, but its still yet another step we should not have to use to read a commonly used format.Yes when we say things crash, often what we mean is that they seem to lose touch with the screenreader, or hang for some minutes for no good reason.

then copy the entire page into something which will retain the formatting.  
others may tell you if Word, or some other program does this.  Then, you 
would copy only what you want of the entire page to the clipboard and paste it 
wherever you want.  
 
Either that, or use a JAWS demo where, I 
believe copy from page is the default.  NVDA copies from the browse mode 
buffer and you can't change that unless you turn off the browse mode buffer and 
copy the entire page since you can't select by phrase, line, etc. if you turn 
off the browse mode buffer.
 
Again, as yesterday, this is an important matter of 
user definable options that should be available.  Perhaps a small group 
should be convened to consider such important options and implement them.  
NVDA will not be a properly capable employment or academic grade screen-reader 
until these sorts of abilities are implemented.

browse mode on, that is, one column of a table, then below that whole column, 
another table such as all the days of the week in a column, then the holidays

control a, Copy it to the clipboard, then paste it into a program where the 
formatting is retained and edit it there.  The whole point of browse mode 
is to give you a virtual cursor so you can move around the page as though there 
were a real cursor and it also reformats the page in some ways to make reading 
logical for blind readers.  
 
Without browse mode, you can move as though there 
were a cursor because there isn't one, except in edit fields.
 
The question is, when you select using the virtual 
cursor, are you selecting text as it appears in the virtual cursor or as it 
appears on the actual page?  Formatting, the kind of font, italics, etc. 
may be retained either way.  Try down arrowing through a table in browse 
mode and select as you go.  Copy to the clipboard and paste in a 
program.  Are the columns arranged as they should be or are they all 
columns, one underneath the other as they appear in browse mode.  

 
I just tried this on one site.  Note the 
difference:
Browse mode on:
SuMoTuWeThFrSa 29  30  31  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31

19 20 21 22 23 24 25 
26 27 28 29 30 31 1 
 
That is how the table appears to a sighted person. 
 
I would think other structures are altered where 
advantageous to a blind reader using Browse Mode as well.  
 
When corresponding with sighted people, it is often 
important to be able to reproduce material from Internet pages as it appears on 
the page, not as browse mode reformats it for blind users.
 
JAWS gives the user a choice, copy from virtual PC 
cursor or copy from page,  NVDA doesn't and this is an ability that must be 
added if NVDA is going to be a work and academically properly capable

JAWS has a copy from clipboard option and, as I recall, copy from page is the default option.
The following is not hair splitting, or at least not intentionally so.These three objects/areas are used by JAWS (and, the equivalent, by NVDA):  Virtual cursor (buffer), clipboard (Windows system clipboard), and the actual page as presented.I would definitely say, based on my years tutoring JAWS, that copies are, by default, not done from the virtual cursor, but from the page.  Copy and paste has always, even when what was being copied is not visible (as JAWS makes no effort to keep actual visual page and location in the virtual cursor synchronized for text), formatted as it appears if I can see it.  Anything copied, when copied, gets placed on the clipboard, which is utterly independent of the screen reader itself.So far as I'm concerned, this is the most reasonable option, because any screen reader loads its virtual cursor when it gets its hands on something and the fact that the probability that one is likely to be primarily and exclusively communicating with individuals for whom visual formatting is ""insignificant"" is very, very small.  Maintaining WYSIWYG is, as has been pointed out here as the crux of the topic, very largely essential for communicating effectively with those not using screen readers, which I doubt that anyone here would argue is a far larger chunk of the world's populace than those that do. --

You can keep the original fonts and styles from the source text, merge them with the style of the document into which you’re pasting, or keep just the text (excluding the original formatting entirely). It’s a good idea to be careful which option you use, and to make sure that the styles and formatting of the resulting document are as you want them to be after pasting into it – otherwise, it’s likely to look poorly formatted.",Question about retaining formatting on the web when copying to the clipboard,30

    its format.
    I will move to the beginning of the table and call the mouse and
    lock the left mouse button.
    Then move to the end of the table and call the mouse once again and
    unlock the left mouse button.
    Finally, to select copy from context menu, and this is done.
    This practice comes from how I asked people who used the mouse to
    copy it.
    They said, hold down the left mouse button to pull the range you
    want to select and then release the left button and select Copy.

The author seems to have more or less abandoned it, but I would respectfully suggest it's worth buying for what it is now.    EasyReader is not as fast or stable, its access to libraries is nice, but it seems to be a package sold to sighted people for blind people to use rather than sold to blind people themselves. I found it unusable generally and gave up on it. Balabolca is really nice but doesn't support, so far as I know, tables of contents at all. I would love to be wrong about this, but it basically makes your epub one long text file. Both Firefox and Edge support opening epubs, though I believe Firefox still needs extensions to do this properly. In any case, I have found that browser support for the files is bad. Navigation is difficult, loading is slow, and some files just don't work. Kurzweil 1000, and I think Openbook, also support Epub, but only as part of their other functions, I wouldn't buy them just for that support. I may say that they're both slower and more unwieldy than QRead for just reading, though obviously they do far more than read. I hope that's of use, and would welcome corrections or additions, it's always good to have many ways of doing things. I am tempted to say that the only really smooth way of reading Epub on Windows is QRead. I wish it weren't so, it's never good to be stuck with one application, particularly when that application has been more or less left and requires online activation, but it's where we are as far as I can see.Aman",Reading epub books with NVDA,30

Subject: [nvda] Talking about Tor: Is there any
            tutorial to use the programme?




      Hello list,

      I've been wanting to use Tor for a whle, more out of curiosity
      than of 
      real need, but have never found anyone to give me clues.

      Is there any tutorial available, possibly in text, but also in
      audio for 
      lack of text?

      Thanks in advance for any help you can give.
      Ciao,
      Ollie

Two.   One is to log in to your e-mail service provider's webmail interface and take a look at what the trash folder looks like there.  My guess, and it's only that, is that Thunderbird will only be capable of manipulating trash messages that it had a role in placing there.  If you have an ancient mountain of them either from webmail or elsewhere (another e-mail client) that Thunderbird can't touch then you'll need to empty trash once from webmail and this should then cease to occur.If the above is not the case, then contact your e-mail service provider.   This is very odd behavior, and a typical IMAP server should be able to hold untold thousands of messages per user, including their trash messages, without issue.My gut is telling me that you are somehow just below whatever the ultimate limit for trash is, and that Thunderbird is not actually clearing messages it didn't send there in the first place. --

unchecking this setting but it is a bad idea.  First, the problem isn't 
caused by compacting.  it is necessary to compact the folder to have it 
accept more messages.  Thus, compacting is not the problem.  

 
Second, at least in the e-mail programs I have read 
about this in, when you delete a message, it is still in the folder.  It is 
compacting that actually removes the message.  So, if you uncheck 
compacting, the uncompacted folders will grow larger indefinitely and may well 
lead to performance problems.  
 
In short, don't do this.  it won't solve the 
problem and may cause problems you don't have now in other folders.

distinguished between POP3 accounts and IMAP accounts.  I don't use IMAP so 
I won't address that.  My guess is that if you uninstall the program, it 
leaves your folders on the computer if you are using POP3.  If there is a 
problem with the folder, uninstalling and reinstalling the program may 
accomplish nothing.  removing the folder and allowing the program to 
automatically create a new one when you run it may solve the problem.  I 
have no idea if going back to a previous version of the program would 
help.  I don't use Thunderbird and I don't know how you would delete the

the folder may be the best thing to try as a first attempt to solve the

I tried to delete the trash folder of an account and the related

      properties, in my case:
C:/Users/Adriano/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/uaip436j.default/Mail/pop.mail.yahoo.it/
I restarted TB, and ... even worse, it did not erase anything
      anymore, it allowed me to correct the folder from the properties.
In the end I restored the 2 files from the Windows trash.
I do not know what to say, it seems that this happens also to
      other people, but not everyone.

Thanks to everyone anyway for the help.
I am always listening for other possible solutions.

How can I configure compaction?
In the Tools | Options | Advanced | Network & Disk Space menu, you can:


disable automatic compaction (which is not recommended because your folders won't be regularly cleaned of deleted messages)
change the compaction threshold (for instance if you deal with a large volume of messages, you may use a larger threshold)",Thunderbird and trash,30
57271,Gene,2019-02-26 17:49:08.460059738,"I'm pretty sure there is a portable version of 
Thunderbird.  That would be the easiest thing to test with.  You could 
put an earlier portable version on your machine and not remove or disturb the 
version you are using now.  Immediately after you place the portable 
version on your machine, disconnect from the Internet and set the portable 
version not to update.  If you need to know how, ask before putting the 
program on your machine.

for a long time.  I don't know how safe the other sites are in terms of 
whether they bundle potentially unwanted programs.  I would get the program 
from known safe sites such as the White Stick site I gave earlier or Ninite.

program.  The version of Windows doesn't matter.
 
 
I'll tell you the long way to help you learn how to 
find things in the program and then the short way.
 
Alt f, that is hold alt and type f to open the main 
menu.  All other menus are found in the menu as well as one or two other 
things.
So alt f, as I said.  Up arrow, it's faster, 
to options.  Press enter.
Down arrow through the options and you'll find 
various things such as shuffle and repeat.  Press enter on the one you want 
to turn it on.  If you want to turn it off later, find it and press enter 
again.
 
The short cut key, which you will hear if you let 
your screen-reader read everything when you get to the item is s.  S 
toggles shuffle on and off while you are in the main window.  R toggles 
repeat on and off.

Not that I'm defending true cluelessness, but do take into account that it's sometimes easy to forget ""in the heat of the moment"" of trying to fix a problem that someone might have mentioned that they are blind.The truly clueless won't miss a beat and will continue on as though you didn't remind them.  The situationally momentarily clueless will usually apologize for having slipped into routine and start troubleshooting how to troubleshoot with you.Even I have, on rare occasion, found myself slipping into a moment of talking to a blind person as though they can see.  It's what happens when I remember, or get that nudge to remind me, that's different from the truly clueless.There are mental scripts one has for one's typical audience or audiences, and it is far too easy to slip into the wrong script upon occasion. --

Back to my comment a moment ago on scripts - sometimes these are literal so sometimes your presumption is correct.  As Jackie observed, ""Those folks generally are just a bunch of script readers. They can't go past it because they don't have the knowledge (& sometimes wherewithal) to go further.""  Also, you tend to get a lot of ""least skilled"" people pitched behind tech support desks, which is the diametrical opposite of what should be done, but I get the business tension with regard to putting your best technicians (some of whom, but not all of whom, lack people skills) in a customer service position where most of what they know will not be needed on any routine basis.I make a point of doing post-service surveys whenever they are offered with regard to experiences with technical support.  I have often said that technical support is frequently neither technical nor supportive.   When I get someone who's one or the other, but not both, that feedback is given.   When I get an exemplar of someone who integrates both things and has ""people skills"" wrapped up with it they get that feedback, too.Really good technical support people are as rare as hen's teeth and the really good ones should be identified by those served so they can get the recognition and, I hope, monetary reward that they so justly deserve. --

Indeed.  And this is why I, and others, frequently emphasize that if you don't get satisfaction from the support tech you've been working with it's a good idea to quickly terminate the call and then call back.  You are most likely to get someone else.I will admit, and freely, that there are a lot of people, in many jobs and professions, who are mindless because they wish to be so (or, even worse, simply are so and shouldn't be working with the public).  But there are an equal number in most professions who are there because it's something they want to do, at least at some level.  What you want to do is to connect with the latter, and that often takes multiple tries.P.S. to Jackie:  I have been in at least two situations like that, and luckily in both of them both myself and the other person were taken by the perverse humor of it all and practically suffered asphyxia from the laughing that ensued.  If you can't laugh at your own foibles, particularly when they're accidents and not constant, and have others be able to do the same then you lead a life that's taken far, far too seriously.  I have also been blessed with many associations with people who knew that I do not laugh at people, but at situations, and in those situations they usually end up laughing, too. --

The snag seems to be that some things, and  speech and  explorer navigation are often two of them, that these seem to be sluggish. I don't know if Windows 10 has this feature or not, but 7 surely does and quite a bit of lag is taken away if you modify the default  processor scheme to make idle at least run at 50 percent of the  clock speed, instead of the often crippling 10 per cent.Obviously this will impact on the battery life, but to me more slick operation is worth that and if you don't use the screen, you can turn this off on a laptop and save power that way to compensate.Brianbglists@...Sent via blueyonder.Please address personal email to:-briang1@..., putting 'Brian Gaff'in the display name field.","good, responsive synthesizers?",30

run something that reregisters the dll files that may be unregistered.

Troubleshooting - NVDA says ""unknown"" or ""pane"" in all of your 
browsers, Mozilla Thunderbird email client and other placesIf for some 
reason you have problems with NVDA saying ""unknown"" or ""pane"" check for the 
following symptoms:.In all of your browsers, or the Mozilla Thunderbird 
email client, no matter what you do, you still hear ""unknown"" or 
""pane""..In the browser, email client and other menus you notice you 
cannot get into your menus, or you are unable to use the quick navigation 
keys.When you have been told the page is loaded and notice strange 
behaviour.Mozilla Thunderbird saying unknown while you try to navigate 
it.Your applications key does not work with it being spoken out and 
other strange behaviour in Windows.The running applications icons 
are not being spoken outIt might be a good idea to do the 
following:Please note: If you are hearing ""unknown"" or ""pane"" (as discussed 
above) NVDA might seem like it is still working properly but it may not be 
completely in Windows and other programmes.You could try the following 
solution which will allow you to re-register your dll files in case they are 
causing the problem.Press the Windows key then type the following into the 
search box. Type in ""command prompt"". Once you have located command prompt, 
in the search results, press the Applications key to bring up the context

should re-register all components in the system32 folder.When it is 
finished, you can close the command prompt window with the Alt + F4 key. You 
should notice now where NVDA was saying ""unknown"" as in some examples given, 
NVDA should now read the icons in the running applications area of Windows,

it is gene from New Zealand who has the Accessibility Central.net website that is been diverted at the moment. it is not my website so please do not go to it just in case.


until it is sorted out or hosted elsewhere i have zipped the website up in a program called 7 zip file manager which was used to do it.


you might need a program like that to access the contents of it.

you might have to make a folder first then put all the files into it.

then it is a matter of going to the index file and pressing the enter key on it. to get to the information.


the zip file has been scanned with anti virus and malware programs and it says it is clean.

If you want to download the zip file it is going to be put into a drop box account which i will share on this list if you want it until this is sorted out.

the drop box link is

the free account has much more severe data restrictions and the link may become

happen.  But Drop Box may not be a good place to host the file unless you 
know what the data restrictions are for your kind of account and how likely a 
number of downloads are to pass the restriction.  Perhaps there is a better 
way to host it.  For example, maybe your site should be downloaded by 
someone who has to do with the NVDA site and the file can be temporarily hosted 
there or maybe something like Google Drive might be used.  I'm not

22637,Travis Siegel,2017-07-25 19:14:37.142704954,"Yep, that's exactly what happened.  There are things hackers can
      do to change dns entries if the dns servers aren't locked down,
      (or if the hackers are persistent enough, they can do it even if
      the dns servers are locked down if the hackers can guess from
      where updates are allowed), then it's a simple matter for said
      hacker to change dns records to point elsewhere.  Generally, this
      sort of thing happens when hosting companies leave their dns
      servers open to updates from anywhere (not just their own
      servers/networks), and as a result, it becomes an exercise in
      record guessing for the hackers in question).  Unfortunately, a
      lot of hosting companies still don't lock down their dns records
      even after repeated hacks like this, either because they don't
      know how (someone really ought to teach isps that dns
      configuration is more than just copying some text files and
      dropping them into your dns directory), or because they think they
      can't lock down things because they have updates coming from too
      many locations (this is false, but often times, it's easier to
      leave dns servers open to facilitate such updates), and so,
      hackers have a field day with dns records, and the poor domain
      owners usually have to deal with the fall-out).  Not fun for
      anyone but (presumably) the hackers in this go around. 
      <sigh>
I honestly don't see the draw of all of this nonsense, but
      apparently, someone gets something out of it, which is why it's
      done, but I never did figure out what the point of it all was.
In any case, it appears the problem is (for the moment) solved,
      and the site should be operational for the time being, until
      somebody gets it into their heads to go make said changes again.

      hosting.  In the shared hosting environment, several sites share
      the same machine.  In order for the web server to know what site
      you want, the information is sent as part of the header your web
      browser sends to the server (this was introduced in http protocol
      version 1.1).  When the server receives the http request, it
      checks this header property, to asertain which host you're
      actually asking for, then serves up the page that corresponds with
      that particular domain name.  If you use http version 1.0, or hit
      the ip address directly, then you'll get the default site for that
      server (which is often the first one in the configuration file,
      which might or might not be the one you actually want).

there is a tutorial i have written up but not posted on putting it onto a usb stick and when you click on the start.bat file either the older wway or newer way if setup correctly it will also start a copy of the website along with NVDA. it is just a matter
 of using the alt and tab key to bring it into focus. More for if there is no internet connection most of the stuff is written except for external links like audio files, add ons etc. But they can easily be put onto a usb stick in a folder.

If you do not mind a draft it is not tidied up yet but has directions on what to do both the old way and new way.


the directions have to be done exactly the same. You will need to make a start.bat file and figure wheather you want to do it the newer way or the older way when nvda starts.any how the directions are in the email.


There is no link to where it is yet but if needed can add in the drop box link for it in this email. I am guessing some already have it.




Taking Accessibility Central with you on a USB stick
 
Do you go some places where there is no internet access? Or it is patchy.
 
Do you want to go portable with NVDA and also take the website with you? If so read below.
 
Please note
 
Any external links from the web site will not work this also includes links to the audio tutorials. There is no reason why you could not put the audio tutorials into a folder called nvda
 audio tutorials for listening to off line or been moved to a portable device or you could simply just put it into a folder to browse later on. You will need to press enter on the index file with in that folder.
 
 
Starting NVDA with the website the newer way
 
 
To take NVDA and the website portable you will need to do the following steps. Locate a USB stick with nothing on it.
 
You will need to download a copy of NVDA from the following website at
http://www.nvaccess.org and put it onto your USB stick. Make sure the message does not appear when you
 press enter on it. It is a security message that shows you every time you click on it. You want NVDA to start automatically when the file is clicked or pressed enter on. Move it to the USB stick.
Next down load the Accessibility Central website from      
and once downloaded you will need to unzip the file or copy its contents into a folder on the USB stick. The folder name has to be exact so when the start.bat file is used it will point to this folder. Call the folder accessibility_central and put the
 contents of the zip file into this folder.
 
The next step is to make a start.bat file which will point to NVDA and the index file in the accessibility_central folder.
You will neeed to do this in note pad. Make sure it is exact.
 
start nvda_2017.2.exe
start accessibility_central\index.html
 
Now save this as a start.bat file then move it onto the USB stick.

 
So when you look at the contents of your USB stick you will see the following. There will be a start.bat file, a folder called accessibility_central with files in it and the nvda_2017.2.exe
 file in it.
 
So now when you click or press enter on the start.bat file if done correctly it should start your copy of NVDA the newer way where it gives you three options. This will be to install NVDA
 to your computer, two to make a portable copy or three to run as a tempory copy. With a quick use of the alt/tab key after NVDA has loaded the website will come up in the browser. You can still jump down by headings etc.
 
 
 
 
To update your start.bat file at a later date you can edit it in note pad or a program that lets you. You will just need to make the following changes to the text.
 
You will need to change the version number of NVDA then save the file. It should still save as a start.bat file.
 
 
start nvda_2017.3.exe
start accessibility_central\index.html
 
 
Starting NVDA with the web site the older way
 
 
If you would like to start NVDA with the web site the older way you will need to do the following. Locate a empty USB stick and download the website from the following link    
You will need to unzip the file and put the contents into a folder called accessibility_central on your USB stick. Make sure the folder name is exact and put the contents of the files into that folder.
Next you will need to make a folder called NVDA and have all of its contents put into that folder. This can be done while NVDA is running through the tools/ create portable version menu.
 Make sure you point it towards your USB stick first and make sure you make the folder calld nvda for the files to go into it.
 
The next step is to create a start.bat file this will need to be done in note pad and put in the following llines.
 
start nvda\nvda.exe
start accessibility_central\index.html
 
 
 
you will then need to save the file as a start.bat file then move it onto your USB stick as well. So now when you look at the USB stick it will have the following. A start.bat file, a folder
 called accessibility_central with the website files in it and also a folder called nvda with all of the files in it.
 
To start up both the copy of NVDA and the website you will need to click or press enter on the start.bat file. NVDA will start up, then it is a matter of using the alt/tab key to bring
 up the website.
 
Another alternative you could do
 
 
You could download the accessibility central website to your computer and put the files into a folder on your computer.

 
I might even just zip the start.bat files? but they they are easy enough to make following the directions given.

Hi, everyone,

Yesterday and today I noticed something different in outlook. When I hit
escape to get out of a message, I get a message saying that the body of the
message has changed and do I want to save it. I've never seen this before.
Is there something I might need to change in either outlook or NVDA?

Thanks for your help in advance.

Just had a play so it brings up the reply read etc stuff.


It might be easier if under the review cursor menu that simple review is ticked i think it is called.


Next when say you are in tree view tab once so you are in the message header do not open it.
Next make sure nvda is in object navigation mode. Use the nvda key + the number 1 on the numeric keypad to do this When it is in that mode, next use the nvda key + the number 4 on the numeric keypad to go left. You will have to do this a couple of times
 until you hear nvda say columns to display button. If you go to far to the left you will hear the ones that are displayed. if this happens use the nvda key + the number 6 on the numeric keypad to go back until you hear nvda say columns to display.
Next use the nvda key + the enter key  to open that menu. it will give you a whole lot of stuff to pick from
Next use the down arrow key to arrow down to status, then presss the enter key. I am not sure if there are other menus off there it did not tell me
When this was done the next times I went into my messages it now tell me if they are read , unread, replied etc


Hopefully the directions are clear enough.


The ones that are checked when you go down that list are the ones that are shown.

Thank you very much for this message - while I had no issue
      telling thunderbird which columns to display before - had just
      switched to screen review mode from first message in list,  used
      arrow keys to move  up until had found the column headers, routed
      mouse cursor to review cursor and invoked context menu using right
      mouse button press.


But, my issue has always been with reordering the column display
      order.

      thought of something else, and when had activated the button to
      tell it which columns to display, I found the from column in that
      form of context menu, routed mouse cursor to review/navigation
      cursor, using NVDA + numpad /, invoked mouse button lock using
      shift+numpad / and then just arrowed up to the subject column,
      routed mouse cursor to it again, and hit shift + numpad / to
      unlock mouse button, and voila! <smile>


As in now, finally, thunderbird is reading out from, and then
      subject line, and then status to me, followed by date/time - this
      has been roundabout my last, leftover gripe with thunderbird for
      quite a while...LOL!

      With versions of ThunderBird 24 and older I managed to rearrange
      the sequence of columns in NVDA by drag and drop. I would move the
      mouse pointer to the column I wanted to move with object
      navigation keys. Specifically I wanted to move the Status column
      right to the front. When the mouse pointer was on the Status
      column, I pressed Shift+numpad slash to lock the left mouse
      button. I then moved the mouse pointer to the first column header
      which was, if memory serves, Starred, and I pressed shift+numpad
      slash again to release the left mouse button and the Status column
      was moved to the first column position.

      Somehow with newer versions of Thunderbird this doesn't seem to
      work anymore. I still manage to go through that whole process, but
      the columns just don't move. So, if anyone on the list has figured
      out how to resequence columns, please let the rest of us know.

      did just manage to sort it out this morning by using MK's
      instructions to navigate to the button to invoke the list of
      columns, and then used drag-and-drop there by routing mouse cursor

      It sounds like you are using version 24 of the Bird. In later
      versions screen review mode does not take you to the column

      My method was slightly different but equally effective. Here is
      what I did:

      From the message list I pressed NVDA+numpad 4 until I heard the
      name of the column I wanted to move (Status in my case). I then
      pressed NVDA+numpad slash to put the mouse pointer there. Then I
      pressed shift+numpad slash again to lock the left mouse button.
      Now I pressed NVDA+Numpad 4 again a number of times until I heard
      the name of the column before which I wanted to move Status. I
      pressed NVDA+numpad shlash to put the mouse pointer there and then
      pressed Shift+numpad slash to unlock the left mouse button.

      I think why it wouldn't work previously, was because I had
      neglected to press NVDA+numpad slash on the from and to columns,
      so the mouse pointer hadn't been positioned correctly. Anyway, it

I was thinking just in case this come up again should i add to my thunder bird tutorial on how to add extra columns or remove them with NVDA in the header of the email step by step and also using the drag and drop method with nvda to move a column from one
 part to another.


it would either be written or audio or both.


it would go up to my website called Accessibility Central.net found at 
http://www.accessibilitycentral.net under the accessible email client mozilla thunderbird page.
If it is going to help some one else it will go up in the next day or so.

Well, I just figured out the how to get replied/read announced,
You must activate the ""Status"" column AND you must move it to the left of the subject column (at least if you want to hear ""read"" or ""replied"" before the subject is announced.  NVDA is announcing columns that it makes sense to announce (which means it ignores
 columns not set, like ""Starred"" if something's not starred) working from left to right in the inbox table/message list area.

There, now you can no longer say you have nvever heard of a
        virus being spread via an email program.

I don't know what mail program you are using, but most modern
      mail clients have more than just mail functions.  Thunderbird for
      example, has a chat feature, a calendar feature, and you can
      actually link directly to websites right from a mail message
      itself for downloads.  That is how I obtained the Quick Folder
      Navigation add-on--right from Thunderbird itself.  When
      Thunderbird updates, they always list the things that it's new
      security features protects again--on their web page.  I use some
      of these features. 



If all you do is just receive messages and do not use the program
      as what can amount to a mini browser, then I guess if you are very
      careful and if you receive all messages in plain text, maybe
      you're OK.  



For those who are more advanced users, I would recommend staying
      current. After all things change and functionality of programs
      change. It's not 1995 any more.

You say the digits work with numlock off but surely numlock needs to be on for the digits to work and numlock needs to be off for keys to operate NVDA.  Also check that the ""use insert key as an NVDA modifier"" is checked. CheersChris",what can i do please help,30
39111,Gene,2018-04-28 13:29:09.047048890,"Also, I don't know anything about the 
brand of numpad being used.  I'd try others if possible.  This sounds 
to me as though it’s a problem with the numpad not being compatible.  Are 
there any electronic stores near you where you can test different ones?  

 
Also, you may get an answer about the 
fn key but it may be necessary to look at the manual.  You may be able to 
find it online if it isn't available on your computer.  I don't know if 
Dell support might provide the information.

I have never used the FN key with letters to do this. In fact, an NVDA modifier is not necessary. Left or Right Arrows read the screen letter by letter.Add Control to the left and right arrow keys and read the screen word by word.Up or Down arrows read the screen line by line.FN + Left Arrow is Home.FN + Right Arrow is End.FN + Up Arrow is Page Up.FN + Down Arrow is Page Down.Add Control to the Home or End commands above to move to the top or the bottom of the screen.And finally, add Shift to the above commands to select text. I've used these commands on Asus, Toshiba, Dell, and Lenovo laptops.Each of these computers differ on how to make the Function Keys work without using the FN key. Look on line or read your manual to learn how to do it.Hope this helps.Suzy",what can i do please help,30

39139,Gene,2018-04-29 01:43:30.412466707,"I don't know how generalizable these 
fn commands are.  Commands such as control left arrow, control right arrow, 
left arrow and right arrow are Windows commands.  the fn commands being 
discussed may be manufacturer or model specific commands.  Others with more 
knowledge will, I hope discuss this, but I wouldn't assume they are standard 
commands without more information.  I question how widespread these fn 
commands are used, especially since control home is top of document and control 
end is end of document.  As far as I know, NVDA, using the laptop computer 
keyboard layout, doesn't use any fn combination keys.  these are all 
computer commands and I wouldn't assume they are standardized.  the other 
commands listed in Suzie's message, control home, control end, etc. are all 
Windows commands and are standardized.  they are commands for working in 
edit fields.  they are not necessarily commands for working in other places 
such as in lists and where they are used in other contexts, they have other 
functions than in documents.  
 
You said you want to use screen review 
commands.  these commands are entirely different from the commands now 
being discussed.  They are NVDA commands for reviewing the screen.  If 
you have a laptop where fn and the letter keys you discussed do review the 
screen, such as fn j, k, l, that's because you are simulating the numpad number 
keys with those combinations and you are simulating those keys as though the 
numlock were not on.  So you are executing NVDA review commands.  
Numpad 8, for example, is say current line.  What you want to do is use fn 
and a letter key on the right side of the keyboard to execute that numpad 
key.  I can't tell how much of what I'm saying you know but I'm going into 
all this to avoid confusion if you don't know all this.

    most laptops or some laptops are made while you press the fn key you

    if so, i'm realy glad with it!
