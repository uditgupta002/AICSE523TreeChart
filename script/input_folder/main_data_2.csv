Next was to the name of the publisher which was a link. , This was followed by gift options not available followed by the text “learn more” which was a link.” Next two tabs were to buttons. first of these was labeled “Delete and the title of the gook.The second button was “save for later and the title of the book” Tabs following the active cart went to “saved for later.

44285,Gene,2018-07-27 05:02:39.294766441,"This message is long but people may find it 
useful.  And it would be nice if those who teach enough to be known in the 
field, would advocate that teaching be changed as I describe.  

 
I have maintained for almost as long as I've known 
about these completely artificial, screen-reader created constructs, that they 
are not good to use on unfamiliar pages.  Now, you are giving excellent 
arguments why they shouldn't be used on familiar pages.  
 
In my strong opinion, people are much better off 
using the page as the page.  I realize it is the page as presented in the 
browse mode buffer, but it is the page as we generally work with it and it and 
it is not a completely artifically construct that goes outside of any unified 
page-as-structure gestault, to use a fancy word meaning picture or mental 
construction or framework.
 
It removes the user from the interface and makes 
him/her reliant on instructions on how to do this or that thing, as you 
illustrate in your example.  Just think how much more natural and directly 
working with the page, as presented, it is to tell the student, make sure you 
are at the top of the page, then search for the word cart.  Repeat the 
search if necessary until you get to the cart.  Then explain how to move 
through the cart.  I almost never use amazon so I don't recall the best 
ways.  And this is true on page after page.  What about a newspaper 
site where you want to find the editorial section on the home page.  
Instead of using the links list, search for edito.  Repeat if 
necessary.  
 
What about a radio station site?  If you want 
to listen, search for listen.  If you find nothing, search for the word 
live or the word click.  Using the links list and using first letter 
navigation to find the word listen won't do any good if the link says click here 
to listen live.  Nor will using first letter navigation help when looking 
for the word ""live.""  You have to find the word click with first letter 
navigation.  It makes much more sense to search for words like listen and 
live or click using my method.  You will find the link every time because 
all three words are in the link, just not necessarily in the limited and 
arbitrary way this completely artificial structure imposes on looking for 
them.  
 
What if you are on an unfamiliar site and all you 
want to do is get contact information or use a contact form.  From the top 
of the page, search for the word ""contact.""  Again, what if the link says 
click here to contact us.""  What if it says, to contact us, use this form, 
where ""this form"" is the link.  Best of luck finding it with the links 
list.  Using search, you will find the word contact and the link is in the 
sentence.  This also leads to 
micromemorization of pages.  Page x has something you switch to the 
headings list to find.  Site Y has something you look for using the buttons 
list.  It's not a natural way to work with web pages and you are reporting 
increasing dissatisfaction with how sites label structures that are not how they 
appear.
 
As I say from time to time, 
blind people shouldn't rely on the kindness of strangers when navigating web 
pages.  
 
I want to be very clear on the 
next point.  I am not aedvocating not using heading movement to skip 
navigation links on unfamiliar pages.  Nor am I saying that the skip blocks 
of links shoudn't be used.  Those uses move you past generally used 
patterns on a page to get to where you want.  I'm advocating against using 
the links list in examples such as I give above when you are on unfamiliar pages 
and want to find something more specific than the general beginning of text 
beyond a usually present structure such as navigation links.  And I'm 
advocating using search for finding something in the links list on unfamiliar 
pages where you cannot assume what the link says as the first word in the 
link.  I am also arguing that in teaching, using the links list removes the 
user from the structure of the page and should never be used or taught until the 
end of web page navigation instruction, if the instructor wants to teach 
it.  The mor3e the student works with the web page, the 
better.
 
The links list, this, what I 
consider, very improper way of teaching web page navigation has become 
unquestioned dogma.  I did a tutorial years ago on Internet use.  It 
is the only one I know that tells users, don't use the links list on unfamiliar 
pages.  If you want to use it on familiar pages, that's alright but I 
specifically tell them not to use the links list when using the tutorial even if 
they already are familiar with it.  
 
The other tutorials I've seen 
teach it near the beginning of teaching page navigation.  It's far past 
time someone with enough influence in the field that others will at least pay 
attention and think, make this case.

44286,John Isige,2018-07-27 07:34:39.092349247,"Agreed. I almost never use the lists, I can't remember when the lasttime was that I used one, though I probably did once. Let's see,headings, sometimes landmarks if I remember them, tab, and arrows, andpage-up or down if I know I'm skipping some fairly significant text, andfind from top of page as you've thoroughly described, naturally. That'spretty much how I navigate pages. Usually stuff like 'n' doesn't workfor me on pages, same with visited and unvisited links. That's undermultiple screen readers, mind you. So to my mind, you should at leastknow the commands if for no other reason than you'll know what to dowhen the ones you find to be easier don't work.I wouldn't go so far as to say use screen layout under NVDA, but justfor fun I'm trying it. What used to happen to me is that if you let itread the page automatically, it would read a line of links, but if youused the arrows, it would only read the first link, and that just messedwith my head. But at least in my quick Facebook test in latest Firefox,it actually read the whole set of links with the arrows, so now I'mgiving it a shot to see what it's like.","Amazon.com ""Cart"" page with JAWS & NVDA",31

You are largely correct on this analysis, but at times, I must
      confess, you have a way of stating what could be stated n a
      sentence or two in 10 thousand words. 



What you are saying in a nutshell is that you should always scope
      out unfamiliar web pages and then when you know what is going on
      on such pages, use your quick navigation, links lists and so on.


I do this all the time and it is more or less common sense.  For
      example, once you scope out a page and you know that the listen
      live link on a web page is near the top and the word here as in
      'click here' to listen' is the clickable word, then it is much
      easier to use the links list and when you press the letter h and
      hear the word here, to press enter on it to start listening.

                Thanks.  I've figured some of this out but it is still

      trend toward making objects look like other objects that they are

      that Delete link that is not, in actuality, a link.  I came to the
      conclusion using the elements lists and cycling through the
      various elements. 

                 I still find it strange that the Delete (which is
      accompanied by the full name of the item) button also shows up in
      the list of form fields.  Of course, when I see form field I think
      edit box, and perhaps that's my problem.  I don't think of ""form
      field"" as the generic term for ""object that can be interacted with
      on the page,"" and am starting to think that may be what it
      actually means.

                 It doesn't help when I'm trying to ""think JAWS"" and

This is true in LinkedIn and some travel booking sites. Also of note, is that web accessibility documentation have had deep discussions about what a link is versus what a button is, and they don't really seem to take into consideration the visual appearance of the item in question. Except for next/previous buttons on training sites, a button is usually considered to be an item that acts on other items in the page for example  (remove, add, purchase) Sometimes Web developers will mark an item up as a link and then use a special attribute to tell the AT that it is a button. Think of those places where there was a click here button and you couldn't get it to work... this could be the reason.One final point, not all screen readers use just first letter navigation within item lists.  A search type capability could certainly be added to the panel invoked by NVDA-F7. .","Amazon.com ""Cart"" page with JAWS & NVDA",31

Indeed.Every single one of the ""lists"" features also has its place, and that place is not only after one is familiar with the page.  Going through headings lists on things like newspaper websites gets one through what is generally the list of headlines and doing the same on search pages puts one through the click-through text for the search results returned.Sometimes using the links list (which is my very least favorite thing to use) allows someone to get a quick overview of what's on the page just by arrowing through it.All of these tools are appropriately used in combination.  I am also a huge fan of the screen reader search function and, for those willing to use it, mouse tracking.  You can get a decent idea of what's on a completely unfamiliar page by gliding the mouse around and listening to what is announced that's underneath it.  Very few screen reader users who are not also former users of the mouse are willing to do this, though. --

44315,Gene,2018-07-27 17:02:54.851167445,"I didn't address search pages, which you mention 
and which is important in demonstrating my point.
 
Let's use Google as an examle.
 
Google has each search result formatted as a 
heading.  So I can type the letter h and move from result link to result 
link.  It also has the address to which the link leads under the link so 
you know whether you are being directed to a legitimate site that corresponds 
with the text of the link.  it's protection against being taken to a 
malicious site masquerading as the real site.

I won't go into every item but if you look down further 
you will get to small excerpts of text on the page the link leads to.  This 
helps you decide if the information on the page is relevant.  It is much 
more efficient to type h, then down arrow through whatever you want to see about 
the result link, then type h again to move to the next result link of you want 
to skip the rest of the material.  Or you can just down arrow and read 
everything if you wish.  Then down arrowing once more takes you to the next 
result link.
 
It makes no sense to enter the 
headings list, move to the first result heading, leave the headings list, look 
at what you want, go back into the headings list and move to the next heading 
etc.
 
also, if all you want to do is 
move by heading, typing h will move you from one result link to the next to the 
next as efficiently as being in the headings list and moving by heading that 
way.  
 
And screen-readers these days 
have commands to move by heading, move by link, and move by list while all the 
time, staying on the page and not using an artificial structure which removes 
you from the structure of the page.
 
And of course, a move by button 
command.

What works for you may not work for others.
For example, I like arrowing through a page to make sure I'm not
      missing anything. Yes, it takes longer, but overall I get the
      layout of the page, make sure I'm not missing any information at
      all. What difference does it make if someone opens the elements

I have some very serious arthritis  in the joints of all of my

My point is just that, I appreciate Gene’s time and pain saving methods of 
quickly finding what I need on a web site.  I first learned of his

44320,Gene,2018-07-27 18:26:31.195827818,"It is up to me to give my best advice and 
opinions.  I'm not forcing anyone to do anything.  If others disagree, 
that's the point of discussion on a list like this.  People may make up 
their own minds.  
 
and, frankly, perhaps you might consider that your 
perceptions as a sighted person may skew what you think is the most effective 
way to work with web pages.  For example, you seem to put an enormous 
amount of emphasis on getting a picture of the whole page.  That is a 
sighted perspective.  Sighted people see things as a whole.  I can't 
say no blind person will want to do this, some may.  But I believe, and my 
experience is that I perceive things in general in parts.  I know where I 
am in my dining room.  I know the living room is to the left of where I am 
sitting at the dining room table.  I don't have a whole picture of my 
dining room, my living room, etc.  I picture myself at a certain place and 
I picture where things are in relation to where I am.  And I don't mean 
everything.  I don't, I can't, picture, sitting in my dining room, where 
everything is in the living room from the angle of my chair at the table.  
I picture where the door is from where I am to enter the living room.  I 
can imagine myself walking through that door and, from there, I can picture 
where things are in that room from being just inside that door.  

 
I'm not saying no blind people build up pictures of 
the whole, I've read of one person who does.  I don't know if that person 
saw before.  
 
When I sit at my computer table, I don't ;picture 
the table as a whole.  I picture where this or that object is from where I 
am sitting.  That's how I experience objects on the table and that's how I 
model them.  You see everything as a whole.  
 
I know that buildings reach far higher than I can 
reach up with my hands.  But that is intellectual knowledge.  When I 
picture a building, I picture myself at a specific place, the door, the wall, 
walking toward the door, facing the wall, to the left of the door, etc.  I 
can't picture the building above where I can reach.  If I tried, I would 
have to imagine my self being able to jump up or fly up along the side of the 
building and touch the building at whatever part I was now able to touch.  
I might know that the building has eight windows above each other but I would 
have to picture myself flying up and counting the windows.  
 
Now, to Internet pages:
Often, blind people don't need to know about the 
whole page.  they may be looking for this or that specific thing or kind of 
thing.  I don't have to know anything about the whole page to find the 
listen link on a radio station site that streams.  I don't have to know 
anything about a page I'm going to just to find one recipe.  Of course, if 
I want to know more and see what else is available on the page, fine.  If I 
go to a newspaper site I haven't been to before and I want to find the 
editorials, I may do a search for editorials.  if there is no link, I may 
search for opinion.  I may search for commentary if there Is no opinion 
link.  
 
There are a lot of times when I want to know much 
more of what is on a page.  I may read part of a page or all of a page to 
make sure I don't miss anything of interest.  But I don't carry around a 
mental image of the page.  I remember that the page may have this or that 
link or links I'  am interested in.  I may remember that a link is in 
the navigation links at the top of the page.  But I'm much more interested 
in knowing that I can search for the first four or five letters of a defining 
word in the link that is not expected to be used much, if at all, elsewhere on 
the page.  Edito for editorials.  Polit for politics.  Movies, 
theater, etc.  I may use the find command the next time I am on the 
page.  At some point, I may book mark a page such as the editorial 
page.
 
Again, the page is perceived in bits or 
pieces.  I don't, I can't perceive the page as a whole in any effective 
way.  I may know as a fact that as the page is displayed in browse mode, 
navigation links are at the top, then the main part of the page, the article, 
for example.  But I don't try to picture the page as a whole unified 
object.
 
That isn't to say that your discussions of using 
the mouse aren't useful.  I haven't tried what you suggest and I might find 
times when it is useful, though not necessarily as you imagine.  Not in 
terms of me perceiving the page as a whole, but in terms of finding a structure 
I can't work with from the keyboard such as a link that isn't coded to respond 
to the keyboard and only works with the mouse.  
 

If I believe a method is superior, I'll say so.  If 
others disagree, fine.  it's there right to say so.  If you disagree, 
fine.  Show me where anything I say is incorrect or where your suggestions 
may be superior.  Show me how it is more efficient and a more natural way 
to work to go into the headings list on a Google results page, and constantly 
leave the headings list, then reenter it again.  Give an example of how it 
is better to do that than to type the letter h to move by headings.
 
NVDA developers have repeatedly and emphatically stated 
that a screen-reader shouldn't give information not found on a page in most 
instances.  JAWS is often criticized for providing proprietary structures 
that many people claim aren't necessary and cause people to be unnecessarily 
dependent on JAWS.  Those who believe these things strongly don't say, 
different people do things differently and that's just what I think, I may be 
wrong but, and then givbe their opinion.  
 
If I have a strong opinion that I believe is generally 
applicable, I'll state it.  Others are free to disagree.  

 
There may be times when someone has a learning disability, 
for example, that other methods may be better.  I was addressing what I 
consider to be the best way to do things in general for blind people without 
other problems that may make other means more suitable to them.

You said you like to arrow down a page.  I 
didn't say how people should move down pages.  I talked about how to work 
with pages where you want to find something and you aren't interested in what 
else is on the page.  I didn't say how a blind person should look through a 
page where they want much more information about what is on a page.  Please 
don't assume that when I describe how to do something in what I think is the 
best way, and when I specify the context, that I am generalizing beyond the 
circumstances and context I am describing.  
 
I was very careful to make comments such as, if 
someone wants more information, they may want to look at all or a lot more of a 
page.  I'm specifically discussing the significant disadvantages and 
inefficiencies of using an artificial structure that separates you from the 
layout of the page and where you would use first letter navigation where you 
don't know what you are looking for on an unfamiliar page.  How do you know 
the download structure is perceived by your screen-reader as a link.  On 
Send Space, it is perceived by the screen-reader is a button.  What is more 
efficient.  Using find if you haven't used Send Space and search for the 
word download or even more efficient, downl or to use the links list, use first 
letter navigation and move through however many links begin with the letter d, 
not find download, leave the links list, then look for the word download in 
other ways.

44335,Gene,2018-07-27 22:44:23.700784876,"It may be that I don't understand how sighted 
people see web pages but it is certainly different than the way a blind person 
encounters it.  
 
I don't know if I'm making a mountain out of a 
molehill.  And I don't think your characterization is correct about my 
having a tendency to do so.
 
I fail to see why you are so defensive and hostile 
on this subject.  I'm making two or three main points and your messages 
support them even though you are at least to an extent, arguing against 
them.
 
The thread began with you explaining a difficulty 
you are having with increasing numbers of web sites where a structure appears 
visually as one thing and to the screen-reader as something else.  You 
discussed how you had problems using one of the screen-reader lists to move 
through the cart in part because a structure appears different visually than it 
appears to a screen-reader and you were using the links list so the structure 
was not seen.  
 
My point is that if you don't use the links list, 
but use the methods I discussed, the search command, or tabbing through the 
cart, you won't have the problem.  and you won't have it on other 
sites.  Your own message argues for what I am 
saying.
 
I explained my strong view that 
the links list shouldn’t' be used on unfamiliar pages.
I said it detracts from 
effective teaching because it uses completely artificial constructs and removes 
the user from the page.  And I said that it shouldn't be taught until the 
student has thoroughly mastered navigation using the web page 
itself.
 
To this, and to my concrete examples and very 
specific arguments, you wrote a quarrelsome, almost attack that maybe some day 
it will occur to me that there are other ways of doing things than mine.  
That is completely beside the point and irrelevant.  I made a very good 
case for my views and why I think they are by far best practices.  
Attacking me and accusing me of rigidity won't win the argument.  You 
haven't given any specific counterexamples or arguments against what I said 
except that different people are different.  That has nothing to do with 
best practices.  If you don't generalize about best practices and try to 
account for exceptions that don't represent the general, how can you teach 
anything?  
 
I've done a little teaching.  If the person 
had problems understanding or working in the way I think is the best practice to 
teach, I would use other methods.  
 
And I didn't prescribe or say that people have to 
use this or that method.  I discussed using the find command, move by 
headings, skip blocks of links commands, and move by button.  Hardly 
rigid.  I'm giving different ways of movement that one may use depending on 
circumstances and page layout and on how you want to work with the page.  I 
also said specifically that if you want to know a lot about what is on a page, 
you may want to read some or all of the page.
 
I discussed the mouse because you attacked me as 
being rigid and dictatorial.  I didn't do so as an attack, however,  
And you don't have to apologize for anything.  But it is certainly the 
case that a sighted person may approach something In not necessarily the best 
manner for a blind person to learn because of thinking of things as perceived in 
the sighted way.  I didn't say you generally do this.  It doesn't 
appear to me that you do.  And I am not discounting the value of getting 
sighted help when useful or important.  But my point still 
stands.
 
But based on twenty years of Internet use, thinking 
about what works well and what doesn't, and observing the kinds of problems many 
blind people have using the Internet, I dispute the amount of emphasis you seem 
to place on use of the mouse to get a picture of the web page.  

 
If you are interested, I will discuss what I 
consider the most effective way to give blind people an understanding of the way 
a sighted person sees a web page layout as compared with a blind person, using 
browse mode which reformats the page.  
 
Your tone has been increasingly hostile and 
dismissive.  If you want to answer, I'll give you the last word.  I've 
pretty much said everything I have to say and you may have a response.  I 
think people pretty well have decided what they think of our differences so I 
won't keep arguing various points.

44375,Gene,2018-07-28 16:50:33.025198914,"One more message in this thread from me.  I 
wasn't going to write any more in this thread but after trying the links list 
again, I see more serious disadvantages of it and I think they should be 
addressed.  
 
Those interested in the topic may find useful 
information as well.  In addition, since NVDA volunteers create 
instructional material, the following may contribute to better material.  

 
Now, let's consider the disadvantages I spoke 
of.  
 
First, you may have to select the structure you 
want to look for.  Let's take the Google page for an example.  If you 
were on a different page the last time and were searching through links, this 
time, on Google, you first have to select headings as the structure you want to 
search through.  So we are already at two extra and completely unnecessary 
steps.
 
One, open the links list.  Two, select 
headings as the structure you want to use which requires shift tabbing once and 
down arrowing once, then tabbing back to the list.  So that is actually 
three completely unnecessary steps.  
Now, you down arrow through the headings.  
When you find a result you want to know more about before going to the actual 
page the heading/link leads to, you do the following:
You have to use the move to command, alt m.  
This moves you to the heading/link and you are now returned to the web 
page.  You now can down arrow through the information about the result or 
read it as you wish.  As I said you are back on the web page.  The 
headings list doesn't move you to the heading as you move through the 
list.  You have to move to the 
heading.  So this is yet another completely unnecessary step.  

 
If you just want to follow the link without looking 
at any additionall information, you do alt m, then enter.  Either way, you 
execute the alt m command, a completely unnecessary command, as I 
said.
 
So let's review.  You want to look through 
results on Google.  You do a search for a topic.
You open the links list.  If you used it as a 
links list last time, you shift tab once, down arrow once to set it to headings, 
tab once, and start down arrowing through the headings.  Google results are 
links that are shown as both headings and links.  Once you get to one you 
want to follow, you have to issue the command alt m, then press enter.  Or, 
if you want to see the additional information for the result to help you decide 
if you want to follow the link, its alt m then read the results. 
 
Now, consider the alternative. 
Go to Google, do a search and when the results page 
comes up do the following:
Type the letter h repeatedly.  That command 
moves you through the headings exactly as you would move if you were using the 
headings list but you don't have to issue an unnecessary command and take one or 
both hands off the main keyboard to issue the NVDA f7 command to open the 
list.  Nor do you do any of the other unnecessary steps I outlined 
above.  
All you do is type the letter h repeatedly.  
When you get to a heading you want to see aditional information about, you just 
read the information, which is right under where you are.  
Or you just press enter to follow the 
link.
So do search, type h until you get to a heading 
that interests you, and either read the results or just press enter.  That 
description was very short because all those unnecessary steps were 
eliminated.  
 
Since h moves through headings exactly as the 
headings list does, where is the advantage to the list?
Since the letter k allows you to move from link to 
link without leaving the page and you move from link to link, exactly as you do 
in the links list, where is the advantage of the links list?  
 
You accused me of making a mountain out of a 
molehill.  Really?  When there are the kinds of important differences 
I've outlined?  And you accuse me of being rigid.  I have presented a 
factual, detailed discussion supporting my argument.  
 
If people want to use these lists, they may, of 
course, do what they want.  But because I make a strong case for what I 
consider to be best practices and best teaching practices, that does not make me 
dictatorial or rigid.  I'm not forcing anyone to do anything.  But I 
am presenting a detailed, reasoned argument which I consider to be very strong. 

 
I've observed the kinds of problems a lot of blind 
people have using the Internet for years.  I've done a little advising and 
teaching.  I've seen that one of the crucially important things to teach is 
the importance of context, to not just open a web page and read every page from 
the top, nor to tab through it and that's all, but rather to work with a page in 
a way to accomplish what you want to accomplish.  What you do on a page may 
differ considerably depending on what you are doing, whether it is a familiar 
page or not, and what is on the page.  There may be pages where you start 
from the top and read some or all the page.  there may be pages where you 
use the find command, find something like a link and follow it.  There are 
pages where you might do other things.  But a lot of people do things like 
just tab through a page or just start reading or don't look effectively for what 
they want to find on a page if they know in advance what it is.  And they 
don't change what they do, they treat pages in the same way.  
 
The links list reinforces all the undesirable 
predispositions I've observed that I consider essential for good instruction to 
dispel and guard against.  Note carefully that I didn't say people 
shouldn't be taught the links list.  Nor did I say they shouldn't use 
it.  I said that people should not be taught the links list until 
after they have fully mastered web page navigation and how to decide how to work 
with a web page, depending on what kind of page it is and what they want to 
do on the page. If the links list is studied before that time, it 
reinforces all the wrong habits students may have adopted in the past or may be 
tempted to adopt before they have learned why they are bad habits.  The 
idea of the links list is sudductive.  When I first heard about it, while I 
was still learning page navigation, it sounded wonderful.  But as I 
learned, I realized how pernicious it is to teach it before the student is ready 
to learn it without detrimental effect.
 
Of course, if a student doesn't learn well using 
techniques and approaches I generally teach, I would use other approaches and 
methods.  I am discussing what I consider to 
be best practices for most students.

 B does not find it, so I search for the word compo and it goes right to it.
Strangely with Jaws, I haven’t tried it with NVDA yet, but when I go to a page where I always search for the same word, and press F3 right off the bat, which
 repeats the last search, it says, word not found.  So if I start a new search, it brings up the word I wanted, and I just press enter, and it goes to it.

While this behavior may often be desirable, there are manyinstances in which it unnecessarily slows down the browsing experienceas NVDA needs to constantly keep track of focus events, decidingwhether or not they are related to browse mode cursor movements. Withunfortunate timing, NVDA sometimes fails to associate a browse modecursor action with its corresponding focus event and bounces back afew lines or switches to forms mode because it thinks focus haschanged asynchronously on behalf of the website rather than the user.The sighted world analogy of moving the browse mode cursor is simplyreading, which should not be associated with so many events in thebrowser.If anyone would like to try out how the other behavior, as also seenin JAWS, would feel in terms of speed: Go to a complex website andthen navigate in browse mode, but not using the standard arrow keysbut instead the review cursor (numpad 7 and numpad 9).All the best,Felix",Browse mode and focus,31

52350,Felix G.,2018-12-21 12:12:07.358787576,"Hi Brian and list,sure, here is some more background regarding what I am observing:As you are aware, both screen readers populate virtual buffers withthe contents of a web page, and whenever something on the pagedynamically changes, those buffers are updated to reflect the change.So in theory, we can scroll quickly through the virtual copy withoutthe screen reader's having to constantly query the original by meansof some inter-process communication combined with code injection.In practice, however, NVDA will send focus events as the user movesthe virtual cursor. So for example, when you arrow to a link, behindthe scenes NVDA will send a focus event for that link to the browser.This has two advantages: First, the browser window will scroll suchthat the link becomes visible if it hasn't been visible already. Andsecond, if the user chooses to switch to focus mode, they will findthat focus is exactly where they expect it to be, namely, where thevirtual cursor was.The disadvantages of this approach are also twofold: First, whenscrolling quickly through the virtual buffer, a lot of these focusevents will be fired, resulting in a busy browser, often amounting toa busy system. If the browser handles these events asynchronously,NVDA will find it hard to associate them with the corresponding useractions, with two possible results: a) NVDA will sometimes bounce backin the virtual buffer as if drawn back by a rubber band; b) NVDA maysuddenly switch to focus mode as it falsely assumes a focus changeoccurred on behalf of the website when in truth it occurred on behalfof the user. Second, objects on web pages may see these focus eventsas invitations to do something, such as play a video, or pop out atext field for leaving a comment, as frequently witnessed on Facebook.In this way users may find themselves interacting when all they wantedwas to read the page.In summary, having focus follow the browse mode cursor makes it easierfor sighted and blind users to colaborate at the same screen, and alsomakes the transition from browse mode to focus mode more graceful, atthe cost of some speed loss and unpredictability. Such an equilibriumof pros and cons would seem to call for an option. I suggest thefollowing:Have a check box called ""System focus follows browse mode cursor"" inthe browse mode preferences. This should be on by default. When it ison, behavior is as implemented right now. When it is off, system focusshould not automatically follow the browse mode cursor, but whenswitching to focus mode, focus should be given to the focusable objectclosest to the browse mode cursor.Let's discuss.Best,FelixAm Fr., 21.

be in browse mode in screen-readers that use browse mode, which is the Windows 
screen-reader standard now.  One thing that may help is to turn off the 
automatic switching between browse mode and forms mode.  I consider having 
this as the default, that is automatic switching, to be a very bad 
mistake.
 
Aside from turning off the automatic switching 
feature, which shouldn't affect the speed of moving through a document but will 
keep automatic switching from occurring when you don't want it to, you are 
assuming the problem is the browse cursor and only that.  There are sites 
where the browse cursor and coding on the page slows movement.  


But if you are asking how to browse with browse mode off, 
that isn't practical and no provision is made for it.  Also, I'm not sure 
what you mean by focus.  Browse mode allows you to work with a web page as 
though a cursor is there, but it really isn't.  I'm not sure what you are 
asking for in terms of focus but the virtual cursor used in browse mode is where 
it is.  Asking for some sort of decoupling is like asking if you can move 
around in Wordpad and not have the application cursor move.  It isn't 
possible unless you aren't actually moving, but just using screen review.  

 
You may be able to reduce the problem by using more than 
one browser.  Some browsers are faster on some web pages when used with 
screen-readers than others.",Browse mode and focus,31

changes.  Some web pages cause something to happen when the mouse is moved 
and, correspondingly, when you move in browse mode, but I haven't run across 
many pages where moving in browse mode causes changes in a web page.  If 
you are asking how to read a page while leaving the browse mode cursor where it 
is and using screen review, there may be ways to allow screen review to see the 
content of the page.  It has been so long since this has been discussed 
here that I don't remember details.  I'm not sure what you are trying to do 
but at times, since I'm using a slow computer often, much slower than it should 
be for efficient Internet use, I select an entire page, copy it to the clipboard 
and paste into Notepad for reading or looking for what I want.  If I don't 
intend to follow more links to get to the content I want, this works well.  
I have much faster computers but for various reasons, I use this slow one most 
of the time.

Itwould feel lightning-fast, as it would only involve changing aposition in an internal textual representation fully managed by NVDAin its own process space. When hitting enter or the space bar tointeract with something, focus could then be brought to that object.The analogy in the sighted world is that of a touch screen: Justlooking at the contents does not generate events, and is therefore notslowed down by anything the browser needs to handle.I am calling those events focus changes because technically that'swhat they are. Focus, in this context, is the Windows concept definedas a control's responsibility for handling keyboard input.

It seems to me that adding a switch like ""browse mode cursor movessystem focus"" would be a very useful fix in the short term. We alreadyhave a ""caret moves review cursor"" switch bound to NVDA+6 - so itseems to be just a question of adding another switch like this. I haveto say that most of the web sites work fine for me with current NVDAbehavior, and for those websites that don't work very well, this newswitch might come very handy.2.

So there is no easy way to go pastthat edit box and the entire website becomes unusable.

it should be off by default.  Too many people wouldn't learn about it and 
they wouldn't understand why they can't do things such as move somewhere on a 
page and have the correct options appear, as I've seen happen on the Drop Box 
lists of your files on the page.  the list changes what files are displayed 
depending on where you are.  Also, I think this might stop the ability to 
move somewhere, then click it with the simulated mouse because you wouldn't be 
on the object.  But for those who take time to learn about it, it might be 
a good feature.

on unless they know about it and understand exactly how it works.  

 
And to confuse unknowledgeable and learning users 
more, it automatically switches modes when you move in some ways and it doesn't 
switch when you move in other ways.  People learning how to use the

If you walk through the instructions below, you can change this setting:A. Using the Accessibility Set Up AssistantWhen you launch a PDF the first time, the accessibility set up assistant opens. If the accessibility wizard has already run, do the following to open it:1. Press ALT+E to open the Edit menu.2. Press Y to select Accessibility submenu.3. Press ENTER on Set Up Assistant. The first page of this five page dialog box opens. The default choice is fine, press ENTER to move to the next page.4. On the second page you can change things if you wish, but by default it is OK. Press ENTER to move to page three.5. On the third page you can change things if you wish, but by default it is OK. Press ENTER to move to page four.6. On the fourth page, if you want to use the list of links, list of headings, and the JAWS find command so on to access long documents, change the radio button from""For large documents, only read the currently visible pages""to""Read the entire document at once.""If you do not make this change, in long documents JAWS only sees the links and headings on the current page. Additionally, JAWS can only search the current page with the JAWS find command. If you do select read the entire document at once, it may take a few seconds longer to process large documents, but it is worth it to be able to see the links and  headings in the entire document, or to search the entire document with the JAWS find.7. Press ENTER to move to page five of the Set Up Assistant.8. If the check box for Reopen documents to the last viewed page is checked, you may want to uncheck this. It is a personal preference. TAB through until you reach the check box for ""Display PDF documents in the web browser,"" and uncheck it.9. Press ENTER to activate the Done button. B. Additional changes in Adobe Reader XI preferences.1. Press CTRL+K to open the Adobe Reader XI preferences.2. In the Categories list on the left side of the dialog box, choose Accessibility.3. Press TAB to move to the item, Show Portfolios in Files mode (not checked by default) - check this.4. Press TAB to move back to the Categories list and choose Security (Enhanced).5. Press TAB to move to Enable Protected Mode at startup (checked by default) - uncheck this.6.

Open issues are either new issues that haven't been triaged yet (that is, no one has looked at them to see how serious they are, whether the issue has already been reported etc), or issues which are being worked on, or waiting to be worked on.  Closed issues are issues which have either been fixed, or which are duplicates of other issues, or sometimes things which can't or won't be fixed.  If the problem with footnotes is that you want them to appear at the top of the page for instance, then that isn't something related to NVDA.  That's a feature request for Word itself and you'd need to submit that to Microsoft.To create a new issue, there is a ""new issue"" button, you can jump straight there with https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/newWhen you create a new issue, there is a block of text in the ""comment"" prompting you for the kinds of information that are useful in diagnosing the issue.  Please try and include: steps to reproduce the issue, attach any files which might help (eg if Word crashes every time you try and check formatting in this particular file, if you can share it, that would help), what should happen and what actually happens, and your system configuration (Windows version, application version, NVDA version and whether installed or portable), and anything you've done to try and resolve or get more information (eg tried different version of NVDA or other program).  Don't stress if you don't have every piece of that information or if you aren't sure if the issue has been filed before.  When someone goes to triage the issue, they will ask for more information if needed.  If the issue has been filed previously, they will link to it (and likely close the duplicate issue you created).If you do have any more questions, please feel free to ask.Kind regardsQuentin.",Github,31

Is there a way to find it with NVDA? I have a tooltip associated with each of the 10 panoramas, but forgetting the youtube link inside the first one, I can't figure out if it there is a keystroke scheme to move through the 10 panoramas, and then, back to the combobox menu.-- Greg Hosler

Then, once you select an item to get to the thumbnail graphics, you can use the down/up arrow in combination with one or sometimes two mouse clicks to move from graphic to graphic.  Would alternating mouse clicks with down/up arrow be off-putting to most NVDA end users?  What Travis Siegel has said about ""moving on"" if the process becomes too difficult comes to mind here.-- Greg Hosler

Thanks for looking at the Marietta tour....because the hotpspots in that one are clickable text boxes with detailed information about each park.  The single combobox in that one lists something like 30 parks.  If you were able to find the combobox first, clicking  each item in the list would take you to the first image in each of 30 parks.  All of those have the text boxes with more complete information about the park.  It still isn't clear to me if you have figured out a way to get into those text boxes once the focus is on the first pano in every park.  If there is a way, I would be grateful to learn how you do it.   Then, the next problem would be about how to return the focus to the other thumb graphics associated with each park, and again, how to return to the combobox list so that you can go back and forth to get a quick overview of the infrastructure that exists in each park.  As a courtesy to the rest of the forum here is the Marietta tour link:  http://www.photographyoptions.net/images/marietta/tour.html.  I am grateful for the generous feedback and the time that many members of the forum have taken to look at this stuff and try to help me out.Best regards, Greg-- Greg Hosler

Greg,            If by ""this content"" you're referring to the photographyoptions website, I honestly don't think there is one, at least not at present.  I am sure that some method could be come up with to allow screen readers to deal with moving targets and the like, but, personally, that seems to me to be a waste of time as it would still likely be terribly difficult to deal with for a blind end user.  There is no information that is shown on that site that could not be rearranged, and very easily, in a standard hierarchy of links, not unlike what you're used to dealing with in File Explorer when traversing the Folder/File tree.            Were I asked to make this site accessible, that would actually be my approach, and placing a hidden link much like the common ""Skip to Content"" link that would say something like ""Skip to screen reader accessible version of the site,"" instead.             To my mind accessibility is about access to information, and in the specific case of that site, and its presentation idiom, trying to make the idiom accessible would more than likely end badly, while creating its equivalent database of information, in correctly arranged and accessible by existing means form, is a better use of time and effort.  I think that in all my years of dealing with screen readers and web acc --

We then made the decision that as Microsoft - and many other companies - had dropped support for XP some time ago, that we could create a better experience for the vast majority of our users, by dropping XP support as well, and pushing anyone on XP who tried to install a newer version of NVDA than 2017.3 to use 2017.3 (which will still be available from the site for users of XP).  For users of XP, NVDA 2017.3 will continue to run, particularly as they will continuously be more limited in what other new programs they can use as well as other programs drop support in newer versions.In any case, we will certainly let people know before we drop support for Windows 7.Now, re extra voices, I would recommend choosing from https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/ExtraVoices, which includes both free and commercial voices.Kind regardsQuentin.",How much does the eloquence and vocalized voice pack cost,31

12684,Nimer Jaber,2016-12-19 03:28:19.772732778,"Hello all,I have been keeping an eye on list traffic over the past couple of days, and have waited for things to settle down a bit before coming on board. I wish to take this opportunity to say a couple of things, and to start something new for this list.As some may remember, Joseph helped me moderate this list for a long while, and he did a wonderful job at that. This list got used to his moderation style, and I found his style to be effective most of the time. I stepped in when needed, and he stepped in when needed, but on the whole, this list for the most part moderated itself. On lists that I run, I find this to be beneficial as even though a thread may be off-topic, it usually does not last long, and the thread may contain valuable information to somebody. At times, I have had to shut down certain topics, and the moderation team has been in agreement on that, but those times are few. I have always asked members of this list to reach out if they disagree with a decision, and I have said that all list members will be heard. List members can reach out to the list owner address, or to me personally, and I will be happy to help and serve in the best way possible. We won't always agree, but I will hear you out, and I will make sure that you know why a decision was made as it was, and I will give you the opportunity to change my mind. In addition, this list does have a sublist for discussion of list matters, although I don't see that as being used on most lists where it exists, and in any case, list matters on this list at any rate, are not all democratic. Why? Because this list made that clear during past decisions.During the past year, Joseph stepped down, and this list elected not to have elections for a new moderator. I asked for volunteers that wished to become a moderator after this list elected not to have a democratic process. I also asked for nominations. Jene was my pick out of two candidates to be moderator because he is knowledgeable, he has participated on this list for a long time, many on this list respect him for his contributions, and he demonstrated to me a willingness to work with me and to work for this list to serve its membership in the best way possible. I asked after he was selected to be a moderator that all of us welcome Jene, and to treat him with the respect that you have treated me and Joseph in the past. Gene is not Joseph, and he has a different style of communication. However, both of us are in agreement to continue to allow this list for the most part to run itself, and we are both in agreement to be listers, just as all of you are, except for when we need to step up to the podium to deal with a situation. So far, I hope all of you can agree with my assessments of the situation.Over the past few days, some questions have come up about the moderation of this list. I want to thank Stuart and Brian for reaching out via proper channels to register what they feel to be issues. Gene has, and continues to have my support for the running of this list, and has not given me any reason to think that he does not make an effective moderator. However, I am open to hear ideas for how you believe the moderation of this list can be improved, and how we can serve you better to make this list more functionable, and to allow us to be more answerable to you. To that end, I want to once again invite anyone that wishes to be heard to send a message to nvda+owner@groups.io or to nimerjaber1@... with your thoughts, suggestions, or grievances. I do want to listen, and to be there for each of you. Also, I am wondering if this list would like a time to talk about any issues that you experience? This could be something that happens monthly, or more often if preferred. If this is something that you would like to see happen, again please send me your comments and suggestions to the group owner e-mail address, or to me at my e-mail address.Finally, I would like to wish all of you a very happy holidays ahead to you and your families. Thank you for allowing me to continue to serve you, and know that I really am listening and paying attention to your suggestions.Cordially,Nimer J, List Owner","List Moderation

group like NVDA users benefits from a sense of community.  Being on a list 
and never discussing anything else except for questions and answers regarding 
NVDA doesn't build any community support nor any sense of anyone on the list 
being anything but a complete stranger.  There may be some lists where 
strict limits as to staying on topic are desirable, not this one.  Flames 
shouldn't be allowed.  I'm just commenting on the benefits, that may not be 
obvious, to allowing other topics to be discussed to an extent.  I'm not

As to NVDA, I do not think that such an option is built into it. When I installed Jarte for the first time when NVDA was running, I did nothing to set jarte to work with NVDA.

screen-reader mode when it opens if it detects a screen-reader.
 
 
Also, you can't save a Word document in the dox 
format, but you can open dox files if you have the Microsoft compatibility pack 
installed.
 
If you try to open a dox 
document without the compatibility pack installed, an information page will come

Microsoft'sNarrator program isan example of a basic screen reader built into Windows. There are other moreadvancedscreen reader program's available including the free NVDA program and thepopular JAWSprogram.Jarte's Screen Reader ModeJarte runs in a special screen reader mode if a recognized screen readerprogram is alreadyrunning on the computer when Jarte is started. Jarte uses a special screenreader friendlyinterface while in screen reader mode. A number of Jarte's visually orientedfeatures areremoved from the interface while in screen reader mode (e.g., color relatedfeatures, interfacepanels that require visual interaction, etc) to make use of Jarte moreefficient for visuallyimpaired users. The interfaces for other features are modified to make themmore readableto a screen reader.Note that this Help document does not describe Jarte's features as theyappear whenrunning in screen reader mode. It is a goal to eventually create an editionof this documentthat describes Jarte's features as they appear in screen reader mode.IssuesJarte will only enter screen reader mode if a recognized screen reader isrunning. Jarte's titlebar will display the phrase ""screen reader mode"" when Jarte is running inscreen readermode.If Jarte does not recognize your screen reader program then please reportthe name of theunrecognized screen reader to Jarte support to ensure the next version ofJarte is updatedappropriately. You can force Jarte to switch to screen reader mode bycopying the phrase""enable screen reader mode"" to the Windows clipboard before starting Jarte.This only needsto be done one time.If Jarte is running in screen reader mode, but it should not be, then youcan turn off screenreader mode by copying the phrase ""disable screen reader mode"" to theWindows clipboardand then restarting Jarte. This only needs to be done one time.If you guys have added this to the clipboard before running Jarte and itdoesn't work then please check all spelling case of letters punctuation etc.and try again.Example did you try with and without the quotes?

1. When in Chrome, press alt-F for the Chrome menu.

3. Activate the Advanced button.
4. Activate the Content Settings button.
5. Look for the Popup button or you could press insert-ctrl-F to bring up the NVDA find dialog and type the word ""pop"" without the quotes. Make sure that it is set to ""blocked.""
If popups still occur could you tell us a little more about the type of pages which are appearing? Does this behavior happen when you're viewing specific sites?
If the problem occurs more often than not I do think that it would be very good to perform a scan of your system to see if any malware has been detected. Which antivirus or antimalware programs do you use? For a second opinion I'd recommend installing the

52966,Brice Mijares,2018-12-28 18:56:00.483072374,"Max, have you ever took a look of the following tutorialBy David MooreThis tutorial will be done with the latest update of Chrome.I will also use JAWS 18 and NVDA 2017.2for this tutorial, because they both work the same in Chrome.Finally, I will use Windows 10 Creators Update latest public build.I will assume that you have downloaded and installed Chrome.There should be a shortcut on your desktop.Section One:Launching Chrome:One way to Launch Chrome, is to press the Windows key or CTRL+Escape and type Chrome in the search edit field, and press enter when you hear JAWS say Chrome.However, since you have already downloaded Chrome, You will have a shortcut icon on your desktop.So next, find the shortcut for Chrome on your desktop, and press enter to open Chrome.The short cut will actually say Google Chrome, so press G to find the Google Chrome icon on your desktop.The first very important step, is to press Windows+up arrow to maximise the window. Chrome often opens with the window not maximise, and you will get undesirable results.Section Two:Bringing up a web site.Press CTRL+L or Alt+Dand type the following:www.freedomscientific.comThe Freedom Scientific web site comes up very quickly.All navigation commands like: H for heading, E for edit field, C for combo box, and so on all work just the same in Chrome.Section Three:The Virticle Chrome menu:I will press the Alt key.The Chrome menu is open.This is a very large virticle menu that you just keep pressing up and down arrow through.I will press insert+up arrow to hear the first option in this menu.New Tab, CTRL+T.You can press that command right from the web site you are on.New Window, CTRL+NYou can press these commands right from your web page, instead of coming here.New incognito Window.History sub menu.I will press right arrow here to see what is in this sub menu!History, CTRL+HSo, there is a key command for reading your history.You can read a few sites you were on right here.I will press left arrow to close this history sub menu.Downloads, CTRL+JThere is the command for opening your downloads you have downloaded with Chrome.Next, the important Bookmarks sub menu.I will press right arrow, to open this.I hear, bookmark this page, CTRL+DThat command will bookmark the page you are reading.Next down arrow, says show bookmarks bar, CTRL+Shift+BThat command, will show your bookmarks on your Chrome browser for all to see. I do not want that.Here is the important one.manage bookmarksThe command is, CTRL+Shift+OIn here, you can organize your bookmarks into folders, see the bookmarks you have imported from different browsers, and very importantly, you can download, to your computer, an HTML file of all of your bookmarks in Chrome.On your computer, you can press enter on this file, after it downloads, and a page will show up in Chrome with a list of all bookmarks you have saved in Chrome. This is an awesome way to download all of your bookmarks right to your computer, so you can back them up.That is all for manage bookmarks.Next, I hear import bookmarks and settings.press enter on this, and you can import all bookmarks and settings from IE, and Firefox, right into Google Chrome, and they will be in their corresponding folders.Now, I hear all of my saved bookmarks as I continue to arrow down.Very important!Sometimes, when I open that bookmarks sub menu, I do not land on the choices I mension here, but instead, I start hearing my saved bookmarks. If this happens, I press up arrow a few times, and it gets me to these choices.Keep in mind, that many of these choices, like bookmark manager, have key commands, so you do not have to come to this bookmarks sub menu at all. You only need to come here most of the time, to arrow through your saved bookmarks, and enter on the desired one.To save a web site as a bookmark,Just press CTRL+D and press enter, and your bookmark is saved.I will now press left arrow, to close the Bookmarks sub menu!I will continue to down arrow through this virticle Chrome menu that we entered by just pressing alt.The next few are very self explanatory.The next one I will mension, is the more tools submenu.I will press right arrow on this.I hear Save Page as, and the command, CTRL+S.Next, Save to desktop.This allows you to save the favorite of the page right to your desktop. This is how you do this in Chrome, instead of doing this in the file menu in IE.It is hidden under this more tools submenu.Clear Browsing data, and there is the key command, CTRL+Shift+Delete key.Extentions, In here, you can add extentions, delete extentions and so on.These are the same as add ons, in IE.I will press left arrow, to close the More Tools sub menu, and we are back to the virticle Chrome menu.The last two that I will mention, are settings, and the help sub menu.If you press the left arrow on the help sub menu, you can open the help system, just like in other programs, so that is all I will say about help.Now, we will press enter on settings, and a web like page will open where the virtual cursor will turn on with JAWS, and NVDA will be in Brows mode.Section Four:Adjusting Settings and Advanced settings:Now that this web page is open, I will just down arrow down the page and we will deal with each setting.Important:I have already signed into Chrome.So now, arrow down until you hear sign into Chrome and press enter.You just enter your email address and password, I think it has to be the same email address and password that you used to set up your Google account.I am not sure about this.You do not need to sign into Chrome, if you do, you can sync all of your activity between all devices that you have Chrome on. That is the only advantage of signing in.I will continue with what I hear after you have signed in.If you do not sign in, press H until you hear Appearance.Each group of settings is a heading that you can get to by pressing H. This makes it very easy, because you just press H until you hear the group of settings you want to work with.Now, because I have signed in, this is what I hear before getting to appearance.The first thing you hear:Settings.That is the very top of the web page.Down arrow, and you hear:Main Menu Button.That will just take you back to the virticle menu we were in.If you down arrow again, you will just hear blank.Down arrow, again, and you hear:Settings again, but now, this is a heading. You can get here just by pressing H at the top of the page.If you down arrow, you hear:Search Settings.This is where you can type in a setting that you want to change.Down arrow again, and there is the edit field where you type in the setting you want to work with.Down arrow again, and you hear another heading saying people.Down arrow again, and I hear David Clickable.This is because I have already signed into Chrome.Down arrow again, and I hear my Gmail email address.Again, this is because I have already signed into Chrome to sync my settings and all of that.Down arrow again, and I hear:Edit person.This is where I could change my name.Down arrow again, and I hear:Sign Out.This is because I have already signed in to Chrome.Down arrow again, and I hear:Sync.Down arrow again, and I hear:On, Sync everything.This is a combo box, where you can choose what to sinc; I chose everything in this combo box.Again, all of this is because I have signed into Chrome already.Down arrow again, and you hear:Sync button.Down arrow again, and you hear:Manage other people clickable.Don't worry about the clickables. There is a clickable for many things, but then there is the button you enter on right after that. Down arrow again, and you hear:Manage other people button.This is what you would press enter on to set up another user.Down arrow again, and you hear:Import bookmarks and settings Clickable:Down arrow again, and you actually hearImport bookmarks and settings button.Here, you press enter and import all of your bookmarks and settings from other Browsers like IE.This is another way of doing this, because remember,We had a choice of manage bookmarks in the book marks sub menu in the virticle menu.There is more than one place to do things in Chrome.Now, we have a series of headings, that you can just press H for heading, to get to.Now, we have gotten to the appearance heading. Down arrow and you hear:themes, which I did nothing with.Next, you can open the Chrome web store. You can get hundreds of extentions, and more.Then, you hear Themes button.Do nothing with this.Next, you hear:Show home clickable.Just skip that.There are many buttons that say clickable, and then there is a button that you actually press enter on to work with it.Just work with the buttons, and skip over these vclickables.Down arrow, and you have an edit box where you can put in your home page you want to get to by pressing Alt+Home.Next, there is the home button toggle.Press the spacebar to turn this on or off. If it is on, you can have the home button show at the top of the Chrome Window.I have it checked.Now, there are two radio buttons, and I chose the one to enter with a custom web address.Search Heading:We are at another heading, where you can set your search Engine.There is a combo box below, and I set it to Chrome, because I like to have my searches from the address bar done with Crome instead of Bing.Next heading:Default Browser.Here, you can choose weather you want Chrome to be your default browser or not.Just leave this alone if you do not want Chrome to be your default browser.Next Important heading:On Start up.Here is where you put in your URL that you want to show as soon as you start Chrome.There are three radio buttons to pick from, but I chose to open with a specific page or pages, which is the third radio button.Under this, you can type in the URL of the web site that you want to open when you start Chrome.Under this, there is a link where you can add more pages you want to show when Chrome starts up.Now, we are up to the search engin heading.This is a heading.There are headings on this settings page.I chose to use Google search engin in the address bar. This is a combo box.The next heading, is on start up.Finally, here is where you set up your home page.There are three radio buttons here.I chose the third one, to open a selected page or selected pages.Next, I was able to enter:www.Google.Com.That is my home page that will open each time I start Chrome.Next important group of settings, the advanced settings.Now, you have to press enter on the advanced settings button before more headings of settings will show.The Advanced settings are collapsed, so you have to press enter to show more headings of settings.Now that these advanced settings are open, we get to the next heading of settings.There is much more we can customize under the advanced settings.Privacy and security heading:Down arrow from here, and you hear:Use a web service to resolve navigation errors.You have a clickable, and a toggle.Press spacebar to toggle this on or off.Again, ignore the clickables.Now you have:Use a prodiction service to enable you in searches.I left this unchecked.Next, you have a setting to speed up the loading of web pages:I checked this with spacebar.The next three settings I just left alone.I checked the one that says:Use a web service to help with spelling.I leave manage certificates alone.Next, you have content settings, but this is not a new heading.We are still working with the same heading.The only thing of interest here, is the clear history button.This was available in the virtical menu, so don't worry about this.Now, we get to the next heading of settings.Passwords and forms:Under this heading, just make sure that you check to be able to have Chrome save passwords.Languages Heading:I did nothing with this.Downloads heading:This is where you choose where you want your downloads to be saved on your computer.Printing heading:I did nothing with this.Accessibility heading:I did nothing with this.Now, we have the System heading:Down arrow, and you hear:Continue running background apps, when Google Chrome is Closed.I have this unchecked.Next,Use hard ware excelloration when Available.I have this checked.Next, you hear:Open proxy settings button.I left this alone.Last Heading LOL!Reset.Here, you can reset all settings back to their origional.We are done with Settings.Now, just press CTRL+F4 to get back to the Freedom Scientific Web site.This settings web page, opens in another tab.That is it for settings.Notice, we made a lot of changes under the advanced settings. You cannot see these, unless you press enter to expand these.Now, press the Alt key again. Up arrow once to get to the end of the menu where we were with the settings.You see exit, up arrow and you see the help sub menu, right under the settings choice.I press right arrow on this help sub menu, and you can enter on the help center to get a lot of help using Chrome.To open a web site, just press CTRL+L or Alt+D and type the URL.Chrome for me, is so much quicker with web sites that involve streamming TV and Watching movies, and so on.For me, Chrome opens large news sites very quickly compared to IE.Lastly, All JAWS and NVDA navigation key commands work in Chrome. For example, you can press F7 to open a list of links with JAWS, and the elements list with NVDA. All of that is the exact same.This is the end of the tutorial.",NVDA going silent.,31
52971,Gene,2018-12-28 19:41:36.150140931,"What you are describing regarding popups are all 
signs of adware.  Chrome has its own popup blocker and adware can show 
popups anyway.  If you install a popup blocker, adware can show 
popups.  
 
Firefox has menus.  If you pressed alt and no 
menus came up, the browser was set to full screen.  If a program has a full 
screen setting and its on, you can't bring up menus because the entire screen is 
used for the displayed content.  Sighted people wouldn't see menus 
either.  To put the program back to normal, press f11.  That is the 
standard key in Windows programs to toggle between full screen on and off.  
Full screen isn't the same as maximizing a program.  You can maximize a 
program with no problems.  
 
As far as a bookmark bar is concerned, if you mean 
the one in Chrome you can get to with f6, there isn't one in Firefox.  But 
Firefox works very well with bookmarks.  Use control b and you will bring 
up a bookmarks menu very similar to that in internet Explorer.  There is 
also a very good search bookmarks feature in firefox.  I won't explain that 
in this message but I will if you want to try it.

Windows browser at present.  it wouldn't be if it subjected people to what 
you are experiencing.
 
It doesn't matter where the popups say they come 
from.  Maybe the adware is trying to make the popups appear as though they 
come from Chrome to try to make them appear more credible or make people think 
they are being shown by the browser.  They are definitely not coming from 
Chrome.

something affecting Chrome, that raises the question of what you may be doing to 
expose yourself to adware or malware.  I would urge you to use No 
Script with Firefox, which will provide some protection against adware and 
malware being installed in the first place.  I don't know enough about 
the plugin to tell you the best way to set it.  I'll mostly leave that to 
others.  Whether you go to sites that are more likely to infect you, 
install free software from the Internet without using Unchecky, which helps 
protect you from unwanted programs being installed along with the free software 
you are installing, or other practices that expose you, it appears you are doing 
things that make it more likely you will become infected with adware or other 
forms of malware.  This would likely be of value to discuss further.  
Prevention is as or more important than removing something once it 
is there.

doesn't actually announce this because the operations have been performed.  
It is equivalent to a key label and only confirms that the correct keys have 
been pressed.  Therefore, you may hear copy and paste when the operation 
was not performed.  
 
For small amounts of text, you can check to see if 
copying occurred by using the command NVDA key c, which will read small amounts 
of text on the clipboard.  It's something like up to five hundred 
characters.  For larger amounts, you will hear an announcement about how 
many characters were copied but it won't be read.  The feature tells you 
nothing about what has been copied if you are copying files or folders to the 
clipboard.  it says, ""No text on clipboard.""

Access can do this, and know when material is actually being copied, pasted, 
etc., then I doubt it is that difficult to do.  
 
My impression over the years is that it is a matter 
of ideology for the main developer or developers.  They claim 
that a screen-reader shouldn't give information that is not available to sighted 
users.  That may be true in general.  But ideology, when too rigidly 
held to, produces undesirable results at times.  And I'd bet that sighted 
people do get some sort of notice.  I don't know what it is.  Does the 
material appear different in some way or does something else happen?  At 
any rate, finally, this is being addressed through an add on, though it should 
be in NVDA itself.  
 
I would say, regarding the add on itself, 
that the word text and item are unnecessary.  The user should know 
whether he/she is copying text or a file.  I don't want to be told what I 
should already know.

NVDA doesn't announce copy and paste except when in browse

        doesn't actually announce this because the operations have been
        performed.  It is equivalent to a key label and only confirms
        that the correct keys have been pressed.  Therefore, you may
        hear copy and paste when the operation was not performed.  
 
For small amounts of text, you can check to see if copying
        occurred by using the command NVDA key c, which will read small
        amounts of text on the clipboard.  It's something like up to
        five hundred characters.  For larger amounts, you will hear an
        announcement about how many characters were copied but it won't
        be read.  The feature tells you nothing about what has been
        copied if you are copying files or folders to the clipboard.  it
        says, ""No text on clipboard.""

Subject: [nvda] NVDA not announcing paste or copy
            when using control-C or control-V





Hi everyone,
I have not been able to make NVDA
          consistently announce paste or copy on the computers I am
          using in class with students.
My computer does, however, several of the
          16 students I work with will not. Can someone guide me to the
          correct area in preferences?  I thought I’d went through
          everything. But obviously, I am missing something.
Thanks for any guidance in advance.

21546,Dejan Ristic,2017-07-07 10:19:39.802942294,"Well,, I've experienced the same. When you handle a larger piece of text, it might be a bit slower in response. When you handle a file, the response is not postponed. There is one case when the pronounciation fails, though. It happens when you press the clipboard-related keys too quickly so that the very pronounciation is unable to catch up with you.Note:This add-on is under development. Damien Sykes-Lindley is ready to hear from us the users.Cheers,Dejan",NVDA not announcing paste or copy when using control-C or control-V,31

commands.  Perhaps this may be reduced or eliminated but even with the 
delay, finally, after years, we can know without checking in other ways, whether 
something has been copied and pasted.  Finally.

Spend a week incorporating the keyboard shortcutinto your regular typing and work flow. After you’ve mastered that group of 10 or 15 shortcuts, come back and find some more to learn. Within a few weeksyou’ll learn the most used shortcuts and master all of them over a couple of months. Assuming you’re using a notebook computer, “Windows” below refers to the Windows logo key, usually somewhere left of the space key like the Lenovo keyboardabove. On some touch screen computers or tablets there’s a button near the display with a Windows logo on it, as is the case with the Surface Pro 3. It’sjust right of the display. This button does not work like the WINDOWS key on the keyboard. windows 10 onscreen keyboard Bring up the onscreen keyboard on touch screen tablets or laptops by clicking or tapping on the keyboard icon in the lower right corner near the time/date.The onscreen keyboard includes a few keyboard layouts. One looks like a full keyboard on some devices. Get to it using the keyboard button on the onscreenkeyboard (see above) in the lower right. Tap on it to show the keyboard/input selector. Finally, when you see a plus in the keyboard shortcuts below, don’t press the plus key on the keyboard. Instead WINDOWS+A means use the Windows key andthe A key only. New Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts The following Windows 10 keyboard shortcuts all use the Windows logo key as described above. windows 10 action center WINDOWS+A:  Opens the Action Center (see image above), which includes notifications and settings buttons like the Tablet Mode button, the brightness buttonand the full Windows All Settings button. WINDOWS+C:  Launches Cortana, which lets the user search for things on the computer and on the web. It also lets users tell Windows 10 what to do usingvoice commands like “create an appointment.” WINDOWS+S – Starts Search, which works inside the Cortana pop up window and searches the web or the computer. Search for a document, a place to eat orthe date of the Civil War. WINDOWS+Tab:  Opens the Task viewer, which shows all running programs as smaller thumbnails. Tap or click on a thumbnail to switch to that program. WINDOWS+Ctrl+D:  Adds a Virtual desktops, which gives users a way to organize open programs and quickly switch between them.

Most of these will seem familiar to many experienced Windows users. Use copy, cut and paste to move or work with things like text or pictures. Copy leaves it there and copies it. Cut grabs it removing it from the spot itused to sit. Paste takes cut or copied text or content and puts it in a new place. Start by selecting text or a photo/object. Then use the following: list of 5 items? Ctrl+C (or Ctrl+Insert):  Copy a selected item? Ctrl+X:  Cut a selected item to paste it elsewhere? Ctrl+V (or Shift+Insert):  Paste a copied or cut item? Ctrl+A:  Select all items in an open document or in the current window? Ctrl+D (or Delete):  delete a selected itemlist end Here’s a list of other often used shortcuts. Ctrl+Z:  Undo the previous action. Ctrl+R (or F5):  Refresh the active window. Ctrl+Y:  Redo an action. Alt+Tab:  Switch between open apps. Windows 10 will bring up a screen showing the open windows and cycle through them each time we use Alt+Tab. Alt+Esc:  Cycle through items in the order in which the user opened them. It works like the previous shortcut, but doesn’t show the windows. It just switches. function key on windows pc Alt+F4:  Close the active item, or exit the active app. Be careful since many PC laptop keyboard put shortcuts on the function keys at the top row of thekeyboard. There’s usually a function key with Fn on it. If that’s true on your laptop, you’ll need to use the Fn+Alt+F4. The same is true of all Functionkeyboard shortcuts on these computers. WINDOWS+L:  Brings up the lock screen on the PC requiring the user to enter their password or PIN. WINDOWS+D:  Switch back and forth between the Windows desktop and the current open application. Alt+underlined letter:  Perform the command for that letter in programs like Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel or other Windows programs that make useof the feature. Alt+Enter:  Display properties for the selected item, like a file in File Explorer. Alt+Spacebar:  Open the shortcut menu for the active window. In a lot of programs it will bring up the menu with commands like Maximize, Minimize, Closeor Task Manager to open the Task Manager of Windows 10 from any Window. Alt+Left arrow:  Go back if the program has a screen history, like in browsers or File Explorer. Alt+Right arrow:  Go forward. Alt+Page Up:  Jump up one screen. Alt+Page Down:  Jump down one screen. Alt+Tab:  Switch between open apps and keep the Alt key down and use the Arrow keys to skip over some windows in the cycle. Ctrl+Alt+Tab:  Use the arrow keys to switch between all open apps. alt plus tab shortcut key shows this Windows 10 Settings Shortcuts The following shortcuts work in the Windows Settings Screen. Windows Settings Screen WINDOWS+I:  Opens Windows Settings. Backspace:  Go back to the settings home screen. window settings search This last shortcut isn’t really a shortcut key, but a time saver.

For example, if I have 3 or 23 open tabs, this keyboard shortcut will jump to that lasttab. Ctrl+PLUS – Zoom in 25% to make things look bigger. Ctrl+MINUS – Zoom out 25% making things look smaller. Ctrl+0:  Reset zoom level to the intended view. Backspace or Alt+Left arrow:  Go back in the browser’s history. Alt+Right arrow:  Go forward in the browser’s history. F5 or Ctrl+R:  Refresh the current tab’s page to reload it. Esc:  Stop loading the current page. Ctrl+L or F4 or Alt+D:  Jump to the address bar to start typing a new search string or site address. Ctrl+Shift+L:  Opens the address bar search in a new tab. Ctrl+E:  Open the search typed into the address bar in the current tab. Ctrl+Enter:  Tacks www. onto the beginning and .com onto the end of any text typed into the address bar. Ctrl+click:  Opens the link clicked in a new tab. Ctrl+Shift+click:  Opens a link in a new tab and then switches to that tab. Alt+Shift+click:  Opens a link in a new Edge window. Function Key Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts The following work with the function keys on most PC keyboards. Again, remember that some computers force the user to use a Fn key to use the F-keys.

I missed that little detail, and you are correct.But, and this is strictly my personal opinion based on my experience tutoring individuals learning to use screen readers, I would not use the Windows 10 Mail App as my e-mail client, either.   There are just too many things that most e-mail clients do, and have done for ages, that are either inconvenient or not possible with the Win10 Mail App.Thunderbird is accessible as is Microsoft Outlook, and Outlook is and always has been the best supported e-mail client for screen readers.  Given that you can get recycled Office licenses on eBay for under $10 it's a good investment in one's own sanity (not to mention it's nice to have a recent version of all of the Office suite programs). --

how much and how it teaches concerning that topic.  but I hope those who 
have will describe it.  Does that tutorial teach Windows along with NVDA 
and browsing?  Should some other material be used along with the NVDA 
tutorial?  Would perhaps a few hours of individual instruction be a good 
idea?  It is available, though you may have to pay for it.  

 
My concern is to make learning as easy as possible 
and to find out what you want to do so that things aren't made more complicated 
than necessary.  There is nothing wrong with Outlook but if it isn't 
necessary to meet your needs, something simple like the app may be a better 
choice.  I haven't used the app so I can't compare the two.  I'm

Feel free to ignore this message as I’m not posting for help or anything like that, though I will end with a question of sorts for the list. I’ve been a JAWS user since, roughly, 1999. I recently got a Windows 10 machine (upgraded from XP!) and was able to get new JAWS at a discounted price from my former employer. I took advantage of the discount just before they laid me off! *grins* Well, obviously perhaps, I’ve been spending a lot of time looking for employment since then. I recently had an interview where they needed me to do a test on a computer. They had not much idea about accommodations for blind folks but seemed very willing to give it a go. With a faint glimmer of hope, I told them about JAWS: that it was the most professional screen-reader around; that “yes, I know it’s really expensive, but there is a demo you can run for forty minutes at a time!”, etc, etc. ‘There’s also this thing called NVDA,” I muttered a little under my breath, “which is a free one; if you can’t get JAWS working, I suppose I could work with that.” I showed up to the interview, foolishly hoping my ole’ buddy the shark would save me. Nope! They couldn’t even get the demo to run, for some reason (the test computer was an old one, I think, running XP). So, NVDA it was to be! I’ll back up a bit and say I’ve known about nVDA for quite some time. I always thought it might come in handy and that I should get it on one of my machines and start using it, but never got around to it. The closest I came was using it on my ex-wife’s laptop, mostly to play music. I still don’t like eSpeak, I’m afraid, and I used it on a Linux machine running Orca before, too. Because that laptop wasn’t mine I never really spent a lot of time with it; didn’t realise it would in fact be possible to change the synthesiser to something more to my liking. Well, there I was, sitting in this open office, sweating profusely and feeling tense because I didn’t really know what I was doing. I managed to switch the voice to the XP narrator one, and that was reasonably ok. I found that everything worked like a charm! I only had to use three programmes at that time: notepad, MS Word and a programme for audio playback/transcription that had (thankfully) native keystroke commands. A part of the test was related to spelling and grammar, so I was able to configure NVDA, without reference to the user guide or any prior experience, to speak the level of punctuation I wanted and to indicate capital letters in a way that was convenient. There was a time limit involved, so I really wasn’t able to play around as much as I should have, yet I was very pleased that I was basically able to get everything up and working to my satisfaction. Now I’m at home, running nVDA, and really liking it. I have no JAWS upgrades left, and that doesn’t bother me as much as I thought it would, though I’m not abandoning it altogether as I’m sure both screen-readers have their strengths. So, I read the user guide. Great. A lot of very familiar keystrokes. Some small differences, but that’s fine and even welcome. I stumbled across the “switching from jAWS to nVDA” wiki page today and read through it; it confirmed some of what I’d already noted. I have also been looking through the add-ons on the official page and just installed the Windows 10 Essentials one. I don’t like these modern universal apps much, but, you know, may as well get used to them if they’re the up-and-coming thing, and maybe they’ll actually work better with NVDA than they do with JAWS. What do you all think, those of you who have expereince with both screen-readers? Any thoughts that might not have been mentioned on the wiki over there? I’m not looking to start an argument, obviously, but I didn’t get a lot of feedback when I posted a similar message (without some of th e sarcasm) on the JAWS list, and I thought it might actually go over better here.  Also, what add-ons do you all like to use? Cheers, and glad to be a part of the NVDA community. P.S.: I didn’t get the job. That’s ok. I still learned something.",New NVDA user,31

But my testimonial is that I got sick of paying for jaws, so I decided to try NVDA for a month, I think it was. There were a few times, mostly with installers or the like, where I'd run into a situation where NVDA wouldn't read the screen, so I'd fire up jaws. Jaws didn't read the screen either. I realized that NVDA was doing everything I needed it to and jaws wasn't offering me any advantages that I could see, so I switched. Pretty simple really. I have nothing against jaws, used it for years, man I want to say from 3 or 4 or such.As for addons, you might want to check out NVDA Remote. There's an addon for Winamp and VLC. I've got Vocalizer for NVDA. The SysTrayList addon is nice, but that's mostly because I can never remember if there's a quick way to get to the system tray without it. NVDA works just fine without it, you can get into the tray and right click and all, but the addon basically gives you the equivalent of jaws-F11. A couple other jaws equivalents are Virtual Review and Place Markers, the latter gives you place markers on web pages and some other documents. Hope that helps.",New NVDA user,31
28700,Damien Garwood,2017-10-31 19:36:23.209253357,"Hi,
Running JAWS in 40 minute mode was about the best I could hope for before 
getting NVDA. There are a whole bunch of voices you can get for NVDA, including 
recently Eloquence, the same voice that is generally and traditionally 
associated with JAWS. If you prefer the complete JAWS keyboard layout you can of 
course remap NVDA’s commands to your liking, as well as have separate 
configurations per application. A lot of this has only happened over the past 
few years. I have been using NVDA as my primary screen reader now for the past 
four or five years.
As for speech synthesisers, they are the most important component for those 
relying on audible feedback only and have thus opened up plenty of cans of worms 
for people. Especially if they are not understood.
As far as I’m concerned, though ESpeak is free, responsive and portable, I 
struggle to understand it due to its robotic nature, its sharpness, and it’s 
tonal timbre. Reminds me of a distorted version of the Dolphin Apollo 2 with a 
bit of feedback.
Concatenative speech synthesisers also have their drawbacks. They can pick 
the wrong samples, you can hear audible artefacts at faster speeds and different 
pitches, and they are less responsive than the formant ones.
While Eloquence is not my be-all-end-all, it is definitely one of the most 
readily available. What’s more, fortunately there is a legal way to use 
Eloquence with NVDA now.
While I believe wholeheartedly that without commercial screen readers we 
would probably never gotten as far as we have with such as NVDA, I also believe, 
just as strongly, that we shouldn’t have to pay any more than a sighted person 
should have to pay for a screen to be able to access information on our 
computers. Therefore even were I given the choice I would probably never upgrade 
to a commercial reader on principle, unless of course the price was 
significantly lowered.
As for addons. NVDA works a lot better with addons than JAWS did with 
scripts. NVDA has a central repository of addons that you can browse and use. 
While some people do create addons and host them privately, the vast majority of 
things that need to be scripted are available officially.
What addons you use depend on what applications you use. Personally, I use 
the GoldWave and Winamp addons. I used the Station Playlist addon until recently 
when I stopped broadcasting.
As for generic addons, again it depends what functionality you’re looking 
for. I wrote an addon to try and simulate, if not improve, the announcements 
that JAWS makes when you access the clipboard. Though it does have some known 
snags...
There’s also the Day of the Week addon that I’m fond of, sometimes I use 
NVDA Remote (though generally only to access my home PC should I be away with my 
laptop etc, very rare for me!), Virtual Review, System Tray etc. Of course 
there’s also ones that I have no need for, such as OCR, weather retrieval, 
speech recognition, translation, enhanced clock etc.
Hope that helps.

It was really eerie to hear that singing robotic voice again after so many years. It’s weird that I have an easier time listening to that than I do eSpeak, a synth still in use today, but there you go. I don’t demand the human-sounding ones; Eloquence is really good enough for me, but I’ve gotten used to Vocalizer with JAWS now and mostly like it … only as you say, it sounds worse when you increase the  speech rate.   Interesting that you say NVDA add-ons work better than JAWS scripts for their respective products.

screen-reader until you know the one you are using well.  You can't make an 
informed decision about remapping keys because, if you don't know the 
screen-reader well, you don't know if you will cause yourself other problems by 
trying to remap keys that the screen-reader uses for something else.  You 
can't remap commands in NVDA to imitate JAWS commands such as the read current 
line command without seriously disrupting the original use of the command, which 
is used by NVDA in object navigation.  If you change object navigation 
commands to imitate JAWS commands, you are destroying the logic of the NVDA 
object navigation command structure.
 
In short, learn the real screen-reader before 
making any decisions about remapping keys.

The reason I say NVDA addons are managed better than JAWS scripts is 
because NVDA has the addon repository. Admittedly I haven’t visited the JAWS 
website in some time, but last I checked they didn’t have a similar repository 
for JAWS scripts so you had to search high and low for them.

In2010 my XP computer started having power issues, so I started using NVDAmore regularly on that computer because it used less power. That computerfinally gave up the ghost in 2011, so, as I couldn't afford to upgrade JAWSfor Windows 7, I switched to NVDA and have used that ever since. The onlything which would make me use JAWS again is if I needed it for a particularjob, or if I was using someone else's computer which has JAWS but not NVDA,but neither situation seems very likely for me right now.As for add-ons, I use several, including Vocalizer, the add-on for Winamp,and the add-on to read emoticons and emojis which are so often used thesedays. There are lots of good add-ons out there, depending on what you want,whether it's extra voices or extra functions.Bye for now!From Clare",New NVDA user,31

Up until recently I had two working machines one on 7, this newish one, and an old updated to death one running 10. sadly that latter one died and is beyond salvage having fried its motherboard with a psu fault.So I'm using 7 and will not update to 10, mainly due to what you say, all those apps but they are all one offs and need  to be made accessible, but I will get a new windows 10 machine soon.Nvda is great for several reasons. You can run betas and you can ask people who know about this stuff to see if they can fix issues and they get fixed. Also, when or if something des go awry, you can very easily roll back nvda so you can carry on as before. this r4ecently happened for XP as you will probably know the last version was the last to run on XP, and is being kept available as there are as you proved old system still out there. Of course no new software is being made for xp, so the current screenreader will be all you really need on such machines.I never felt I got this amount of involvement from Dolphin, despite being a paying customer, that is not of course being too critical as they much have a lot more people breathing down their necks over there.I do however try to donate to NV Access every time a new version comes out. sometimes its quite a lot, others not so much. I am now a pensioner, after all!Leans on old walking stick, well not quite yet!So yes, nothing is perfect, as you say Espeak is a bit of a jack of all trades and hence does have some problems, but its even quite easy to tweak and create different voices in Espeak, Quincy is one I made for laptop use, as its not as shrill as the other ones or indeed the default voice. It has never been good at US accents, sounding like a cross between posh New England and Canadian to me.But in the UK here I find it acceptable.Brianbglists@...Sent via blueyonder.Please address personal email to:-briang1@..., putting 'Brian Gaff'in the display name field.",New NVDA user,31

I use a torrent client and nVDA doesn't seem to work as wellwith it as JAWS does, which also doesn't work as it used to with it on theXP machine/an older version, but never mind. On the other hand I think Ireally like using both Outlook 2010 and Firefox with NVDA more than I dowith jAWS. I'm glad to be able to switch back and forth.I never used Windows 7 except at an old workplace, but I have to say that asproblematic as it can be, there are some things I like about Windows 10,quite a bit in fact. The new file explorer is kind of great, and I'veenjoyed playing around a bit with powershell. And the compatibility modelets you run most old windows programmes that might normally give youtrouble, though the old Qbasic is a write off I guess, so no more Eamongames for me. *grins*And yeah, you never know when you're going to find an old XP machine. Theystill use them for the kind of stuff I mentioned above. You can isolate itfrom your regular network and just use it for testing/training purposes, orwhatever.

Outlook like different messages in the list as controls.  I assume from the 
fact that you don't complain about this in other programs such as Windows 
Explorer, that this generally doesn't happen.
 
That also explains why when you turned off the 
object navigator moving as you moved in the application, that no beeps were 
heard.  the object navigator didn't move and the add-on was therefore 
unaware that you were moving in the application.

    You can find the option to restart NVDA with all add-ons disabled on

    don't, it's NVDA+Q.
    Another way of doing it is through the command line but I don't know

    I'm in a hurry now, but if nobody comes up with such a command, I
    can look it for you later on.

In a way, the laptop layo8ut commands makes slightly more sense (especially object navigation commands, but that’s a bit ahead of the story at the moment).Speaking of commands, tasks and what not: if I’m not mistaken, based on conversations we had so far, I think you’re having a conflict between an important task or two at hand and suddenly being thrusted into a new screen reader world. Am I correct? If yes, I advise focusing more on the task at hand and how to accomplish it using concepts and commands more than keyboard layout.To others: some of you might say that it is important to teach people how to use screen readers and commands. I’d argue that, sometimes it is better to let people focus on their work more than the technology that gives them access to information on screen. For this reason, a screen reader expert (or a prospective one) must not only become a teacher, but also a counsellor willing to listen, diagnose, and offer pragmatic solutions that fits the context at hand. Many expert certification programs (including the one offered by NV Access) tells you how things work and what to do for given situations (or simulations), but they won’t teach you how to become a good listener and diagnosing issues beyond the technology they’re teaching; becoming a good listener and able to recognize, diagnose, and offer solutions and advice for issues beyond NVDA takes time to master (and even if we try to teach uniformity, people have different worldviews within their minds and souls).I may need to devote an entire thread regarding what it truly means to be an NVDA expert and influential add-on developer…Cheers,Joseph",Switching from Desktop to Laptop Keyboard,31

Speak for yourself on that count.I have no issue with anyone preferring one layout over the other, and those who learned under and use the laptop layout (for whatever reason) tend to be driven crazy by the desktop layout and vice versa.I have yet to encounter someone who doesn't find the learning curve maddening and long if they are forced to switch from one layout to another. --

When we have a terrorist attack, on September 11, 2001 with 19 men — 15 of them are Saudis — and five minutes later the whole country thinks they’re from Iraq — how can you have faith in the public?

Unfortunately, I and other NVDAdevelopers have encountered numerous issues where paper says one thing andcode says something else, and in worst cases, we've seen badly formed UIAimplementations to a point where we had to resort to MSAA (Microsoft Officeapps are prime example of this problem). At other times, the UI Automationtree was in such a bad state that we had to write workaround hacks (notideal, but we resort to this in some cases), and the most recent case wassuppressing ""web content"" announcement in Edge (caused by yet another badlypruned UIA tree in Microsoft Edge). Half of my Windows 10 App Essentialsadd-on code is devoted to UIA workarounds in Windows 10 itself as well as invarious apps, and for one or two cases, fixing the UIA issue meansintroducing bugs in NVDA (a prime example being the fact that modernCalculator repeats whatever you've entered).

At that time it was all about audacity. Two brilliant authors in my opinion, Paul B. and Robert H. have developed two complex addons for the same software. Then I discovered, that there is a very useful addon for Microsoft word on the French website. Its functions could have been integrated in the appmodule since very long time. Moreover, there is the Italian addon repository, with very useful addons as well. And there are many other addon websites we might not know about. Well, ideally authors should cooperate with each other on a worldwide basis, but that’s why we organize NVDACon every year. However, there is someone who is creating an addon for his needs and might want to share it just with a small community of people. There are many reasons for this behavior:The author cannot speak English and thus, he cannot understand user feedbackThe author knows that he or she will not be able to invest a huge amount of time in maintaining the addon. He or she thinks maybe if the addon is spread all over the world, the feedback will cause far too much work.The author does not understand the git system or is used to other subversion systems and might not want to change this. The decision of an author to make an addon available for the entire worldwide community can and should not be manipulated by any system restriction or what so ever. The only thing we can do is to encourage anyone to submit his addons. The man power is in place, the systems are in place, the structure is in place. It is not more than writing an e-mail and requesting a review. But it is still the decision of an author if he wants to make this step or not.  BestAdriani  Von: nvda-addons@nvda-addons.groups.io <nvda-addons@nvda-addons.groups.io> Im Auftrag von Joseph LeeGesendet: Montag, 4.

I want to make entirely clear that there is no attempt on my part to even suggest, let alone implement, coercion of any sort with regard to ""arm twisting"" private authors of add-ons with regard to distributing them.  I know that some would do so, quite willingly, if they had some established way of doing so and if it were possible for them to decide whether they wanted their add-ons, and themselves, subject to review and vetting.It should be possible for anyone to offer an add-on for others to use knowing full well that there are no guarantees or warranties of any sort, nor an absolute guarantee of fitness for purpose.This is just about making it easy for private add-on developers who wish to offer their work at no charge to have a very easy way of doing so.  Conversely, it makes these available in a ""one stop shop"" for the rest of the user community to pick up and try.  --

It took me ages to find the NVDA developer API, and that isn't including trying to learn to navigate it, and understand it, figuring out what is internal and what is usable etc. There is still a bug in my BGT addon that I have been unable to find a way to fix since its initial development last year.Add Git and GitHub to the mix and, at least from my point of view, I found that very intimidating. To be honest, this is partly why I don't try NVDA snapshot builds any more, and why I don't submit issues. Even looking at issues somewhat confuses me. Even the version system I use on a regular basis, Fossil, only receives the most basic commands from me. Add files, commit, and update. No thanks to branches and tagging!That isn't even bringing administration into the mix. Obviously things need to be done to mark addons as release, put them through the translation system etc, but I haven't the foggiest idea as to how that works, how to get the ball rolling etc. Despite documents stating that all you need is a knowledge of Python, it's clear to me that submitting and publishing an addon needs a lot more, and this makes me wonder just where my future is as a potential addon writer, let alone core developer.Cheers,Damien.","[nvda-addons] [nvda] ""Unofficial"" NVDA Add-Ons Repository",31

On the other side, we need some people who look into the code itself and assess security and functionality.3.

Acceptance

Developer writes addon
Developer submits addon to the community
Community considers the possibility of accepting the
     add-on through basic review (licensing, copyright considerations, security
     implications, etc.).
If requested by the author, perform more rigorous
     review.

4.1. Check that the addon adds interesting/useful
      features.
4.2. Maybe can be merged with an existing addon or
      included in NVDA's core?
If community considers addon to be useful, accept.
      Addon status is now dev.


Release
and maintenance

Author releases the add-on and incorporates comments
     from reviewers and users.
Author requests reviews.
7.1: For major releases: before major version is
     released to check for license changes and other basic review.
7.2: For continuous releases, at least once a year.
Reviewers and testers check the add-on doesn't contain
     harmful code and authorize to post on the add-ons website.
Authors or reviewers (preferably authors) can release
     maintainance versions of the add-on to update translations or fix critical
     issues, notifying add-on changes on add-ons mailing list.

Deletion

Authors and reviewers should remove add-ons which
     contain harmful code, or if they become unuseful, for instance when NVDA
     implements their functionality, notifying this on add-ons mailing list.

Notes

If the addon author is also a community reviewer, s/he
     can not be the community reviewer for his/her addon.
Users can be considered reviewers when they provide
     significant feedback, such as reporting bugs, suggestions and so on.
Code will be considered to be harmful when, but not
     only, can change, delete or copy system or external files without a clear
     and useful purpose, produces Internet connections without a justified
     reason, etc.
Authors should discuss certain aspects of add-ons if
     they believe copyrights and licensing falls under a gray area (such as
     synthesizer licenses).
For addons, master branch is equivalent to NVDA next,
     i.e. considered for testing purposes. Stable branch is considered to have
     had some testing and should be relatively error free/ok to run on your
     system.
Stable branch will receive translation updates if the
     add-on is translatable.
Authors and reviewers are strongly encouraged to follow
     our guidelines,
     to ensure the quality of community add-ons.
If add-on authors can't continue a required work, they
     can be replaced by another maintainer three months after the first
     request.

I do not Agree with the
wording of all of this, and think some of it should be made more
liberal/changed to make the actual position more clear.  I want to make it clear
that we don’t intentionally check things like coding style. The guidelines are
simply there to give developers a reference.
I think this
should be changed.
3.     
Community considers the possibility
of accepting the add-on through basic review (licensing, copyright
considerations, security implications, etc.).
I propose 
3.The NVDA Community
performs an addon basic review, checking for the following things. GPL Compliance,
and stability and security.
Also, I would personally remove everything related to release process. We aren't here to tell people how to release addons. Mozilla and other stores simply put the addon on the site if the basic review passes. If the user requests feedback on their addon, it should not block review, and a rewrite of this verbage would make that more clear. I also 
This whole document needs rewritten, and is not clearly
written which makes it confusing.","[nvda-addons] [nvda] ""Unofficial"" NVDA Add-Ons Repository",31

I hope we do not get to a point where people have problems with NVDA and we cannot give support to solve them because we don‘t know how an unoficial addon influenced nvda’s core. I used a portuguese addon some months ago and after a while my speech dictionary was broken and spamed with very strange entries. It made ms excel for me almost unusable for example. I thought it was a bug in NVDA and reported on github. We had quite long discussions about it, because many people didn’t reproduce that issue. I even reinstalled ms office, I restored my whole system but the issues were still there. One day someone suggested to have a look at the speech dictionary and I was shocked to see lots of entries with no meaning. They didn’t disapear even though I removed all addons and even reinstalled NVDA. Finally, I had to remove them all manually.So, what I am saying is, I hope we will not begin endless discussions about bugs in NVDA where they in fact are caused by unofficial addons.

If that is determined to be the case then whoever is maintaining the ""unofficial"" page should have the power to remove said add-on if enough reports of same crop up.Even stuff that worked beautifully when new can eventually break if not maintained and NVDA itself changes enough.Is there no way for NVDA to be started with add-ons disabled?  This tends to be a standard feature for most software that supports add-ons so that one can make a quick determination whether core functionality is broken or something from an add-on is the culprit.  Web browsers do this, and JAWS 2018 can be started with the ""/default"" switch from the command line causing all user profile changes to be ignored in favor of what came shipped with the software. --

My point is that you can use the first letter of

Also, you don't have to create a lot of commands for programs if you don't want

7527,jeremy,2016-08-21 05:10:12.592362114,"Haha, a fun one! First, and apologies to those who may disagree, but
    it seems to me that currently, the Start menu on 10 with NVDA is
    slightly less than pleasant to use. :)
    I've changed mine up now, I got tired of how crappy it was working
    for me so I took all the stuff out of the pinned apps area so it no
    longer shows up, but this is what I was able to figure out.

    When you first press the start button and it lands you in the search
    box, you can press tab, either once or twice and it should take you
    to a vertical list containing a fairly large number of apps and some
    of their associated folders. As you arrow up and down here, NVDA
    will first read the section you come to, so A, B, etc and then under
    those, read you apps that fall under those sections. As you probably
    already know, it's here that you can press the applications key and
    pin said apps to the start menu.

    As for the area where Apps actually get pinned, it looks like shift
    tab is what you want, so doing it from the search box should land
    you there. It's here that you should be able to use the arrow keys
    to move up, down, left and right in the grid, but unfortunately,
    NVDA seems to read things here all weird. As something that looks
    similar to how IOS likes to create named directories based on the
    names of the stuff you put in them, as you're moving around here,
    you'll come to these named sections and can press enter to rename
    them. As you're moving around here, you'll land on these sections,
    lets say, Audio and Music just as an example and can sometimes press
    down or wright and it will start reading you the pinned apps under
    that section. If you happen to only have one or two things here
    though, It's sometimes hard to get it to land where you want on the
    icon or whatever.

    I've wondered if it's possible to turn off the structuring of the
    apps you pin here and just have them in a huge grid, but if so, I've
    not figured it out.
    I'm also not sure if this is something that NVDA just hasn't caught
    up with and if there are things in the pipe down the road that will
    make it more friendly, but so far, it is kind of a pain to use. haha

    If you play with it though and figure out anything else, I'd
    certainly be interested. 
    Take care.",dealing with Pins on the Windows 10 start,31
7532,Brandon Keith Biggs,2016-08-21 09:54:35.281927052,"Hello,I think I figured it out.The top row is folders and under that is a grid of everything in those folders. The problem is that grid is really strangely shaped and if you press an arrow key you may jump to another folder. Nice thing is it will announce the new folder, but that is also what makes it so confusing.*Note* windows + d also takes you to the desktop like windows + m does, you only need to use one hand though.

7547,jeremy,2016-08-21 21:51:46.112902254,"Having just enough vision to make an uncluttered desktop with a dark
    screen useful, I honestly prefer windows plus m as it's an easy way
    to clear up the display and take everything back down to the
    taskbar, where I can reach it when I want to.
    I guess it'd  also be in how one first learned to use Windows, but
    visually, having everything minimized with one quick shortcut
      while also returning to the desktop always worked better for me.
    Suppose the same could be said for using the taskbar to get to
    applications and such that you'd been using, compared to using alt
    plus tab to cycle through the different windows until you found the
    one you want. for me, alt tab works well if I only have two or so
    windows I want to toggle back and fourth through, say for moving
    files from one place to another, but for those folks who may have 10
    plus windows up and going, no thanks.

    One other thing to maybe consider, which certainly doesn't apply to
    everyone but is a pretty big deal to me is the amount of light that
    comes off my display if I have it full of nice bright windows. I
    find it much easier on my eyes to keep not only my background darker
    but to also keep my windows sized down a bit more, as to not
    generate as much brightness, especially if my eyes happen to be
    bothering me.

    I find that it's a decent balance, keeping my computer easier on my
    own vision, yet it doesn't have a huge affect if someone like my
    wife needs to use it, for whatever reason. This is where having
    options like screen curtain, the ability to totally black or white
    out the display kinda fail, but in those situations where you don't
    have any need on using the display or you know that no one will be
    needing to read it, then they work well.

Player must be usede in this case.  Groove Music is a streaming service 
and, assumedly, it allows music to be listened to off line, but I would thing 
the music is DRM protected and would become available off line even if ripped or 
burned because such services don't want people to have music from them available 
if they are no longer members.  Such services make money by having people 
listen to and have access to music as members, not by members having access to 
music when no longer members.
 
Also, is the correct terminology being used?  
Rip is creating MP3 files from a CD.  Do you, the person who asked the 
question, want MP3 files, from ripping, or do you want to burn a CD and have the 
music on a CD?  You say rip a CD and, since many people don't use 
correct terms for ripping and burning, this should be clarified.  I'm not 
assuming you use incorrect terms.  But since I don't know, I want to be 
sure you are actually wanting to rip and not burn a CD.",groove music,31

statements that give no information.  We don't know if the person doesn't 
like the price, doesn't like the service because the selection isn't as large as 
he/she wants, because it has become inaccessible after being accessible, or for 
other reasons.  I said has become inaccessible because this excerpt 
from Blind Cool Tech from 2016 indicates that blind people could use it at that 
time.  The link produces a page not found message when followed from Google 
at this time.  Whether that means it is no longer available or just 
temporarily unavailable, I don't know.  I shall produce the excerpt from 
Google for the page without the link since the page can't be found now.  
Those wishing to try later may do a Google or whatever search engine they want

can be ripped even if not on a CD?  I know that if you use Spotify, you can 
have files off line, but that isn't ripping, that's Spotify allowing you to 
store files from them on your system for off line listening.  These files, 
as I understand matters, must be listened to using the Spotify program or, on 
other devices, the Spotify App.  But no streaming service would just let 
people rip files with no protection plan so they can be shared with anyone, 
members of the service or not and they wouldn't allow people to have files in a 
form that allows them to be used if they drop their subscription to the

Kerryn, the Winamp add-on is an official add-on. 
All official add-ons can be found at the following link:
https://addons.nvda-project.org/index.en.html
Browse the page by the letter H for heading, or 
more quickly, do a search for the word winamp now that you know it's there. If 
you browse by heading, you'll find plenty of other add-ons to check out. 
Entering on the name of each one will take you to the page where you can learn 
more and download.
Also remember that you can always get to the same 
place through NVDA itself. Not knowing the Laptop key combinations, here's the 
instructions for desktop keyboard layout:
1. Press ctrl+n to get to the NVDA 
menu.
2. Arrow up and down to find the tools submenu, 
then press enter or right arrow to open the submenu. You can also press the 
letter t for the tools submenu.
3. Up and down arrow to find the manage add-ons 
submenu, then press enter to activate the dialogue. Pressing the letter A will 
also get you there from the tools submenu.
4. Tab or shif tab, closer in this case, to get 
add-ons, then press enter. This will open up the same web page I linked to 
earlier. This way you won't have to memorize the address or bookmark 
it.
With official add-ons, there is never any need to 
receive it from another member as there may be more of a possibility of being 
sent an incorrect or out-of-date version as the person sending it to 
you may not have received the latest version yet.

stopped and use it to

When you want to stop, pause Winamp with c.  

Use control j to open the jump to time 
dialog.
You will be in a field showing the time where you 
have paused Winamp.
 
Don't move around in the field.
Just use control c to copy the ttime.  
Now, stop play and close Winamp.  
Open Winamp and paste the time into it.
Save it with whatever name you want.
When you want to resume playing, Open the file in Notepad.
Copy the time to the clipboard.
Now open the file you want to listen to in Winamp.  It's your choice 
whether to pause it now or leave it playing.
Open the time dialog with control j, the same command as before.
Paste the time in with control v and press enter.  You will now be at 
the time you left off.
 
This may sound a lot more cumbersome and time consuming than it is.

There was an add on for Winamp created by the late, great Carlos
      of the Tech Talk mailing list.  I am not sure where to get it, but
      it apparently worked quite well.  It was a stand alone program
      that interfaced with Winamp and was not dependent on any screen

starts.  Bookmarks, as with bookmarks in a browser, are intended to play 
what has been bookmarked as though you manually opened the file.  It plays 
from the beginning.  Time markers in JAWS are what you need to 
use.

hi ronn
i installed winamp time markers
i did what was supposed to be done, i 
think
when i created a time marker for an audio file and 
went back to play it, it started from the beginning
it did not mark the spot to return to that 
spot",winamp with NVDA,31
